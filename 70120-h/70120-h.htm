<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think of your sins,<br>
  What made you a soldier a-serving the Queen:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God save the Queen,<br>
  And God save the duffer who thinks of to-morrow.<br>
  God save the man who remembers his sorrow,<br>
  God save the man who can think of the past,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sundown at last:<br>
Here's rest for the past, and here's hope for the morrow!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That is exactly what the bugle said to
a man who was sitting on the edge of
the bench-land in the evening calm.  He
was a very big man, dressed in a grey
woollen undershirt, worn-out riding-breeches
with a two-inch yellow stripe
down the legs, and jack-boots.  By his
side lay a broad grey slouch-hat, such as
cowboys wear; on his knees a
bath-towel&mdash;dry; and in his neighbourhood
lingered a faint aroma of stables.  The
man's bare arms were like the thighs of
an average sinner, his shoulders, thighs,
breast, neck, all of gigantic strength
and beauty, a sight that would have
appealed to any athlete as beyond the
loveliness of women.
</p>

<p>
The setting sun just touched his wavy,
crisp, black hair with a lustre of metal.
Again, his face, still, strong, silent, had
an odd suggestiveness of a bronze statue,
that of something Greek but uncanny,
a faun, perhaps, or a satyr.  The hair,
sweeping low over his brows, might
almost conceal incipient horns; his ears
might have been tufted; his features
defying all the rules&mdash;stuck on anyhow; the
subtle devilry of his deep black eyes, the
ugly fascination, the whimsical dignity;
the bearing lofty, defiant, almost
magnificent; and again, an air, indefinite
enough, of sorrowful majesty;&mdash;how well
everything about the man fitted one
name&mdash;the Blackguard.
</p>

<p>
That was La Mancha's name, by consent
of the five troops of the Mounted
Police; and somehow the common use of
it conveyed no sense of reproach but
rather of endearment.  From the
Commissioner down to the smallest recruit
the whole five hundred were half-afraid
of him, except one man; yet no civilian
ventured to speak ill of the Blackguard,
or he would have had his head punched.
To say bad things about the Blackguard
was to slight the Force.
</p>

<p>
And the one man who did not fear this
latter-day satyr, who ruled him as mind
rules matter, was a certain little Corporal,
who, with a neat briar pipe well alight,
was picking his dainty way over the
gravel&mdash;coming down from the camp in
the evening calm.  This was Corporal
Dandy Irvine, with a sunburnt face, a
neatly-pointed moustache, the buttons of
his scarlet jacket glowing like gold in the
light, whose clothes always fitted, whose
forage-cap was correctly poised on three
hairs, whose boots and spurs were always
brilliantly polished.  And now he just
touched the Blackguard to show that he
was present, and sat down beside him
without any remarks whatever.  So, for
five minutes, the two looked gravely out
over the valley like Dignity and
Impudence, both too lazy to speak.
</p>

<p>
They were looking across the Kootenay
Valley&mdash;the upper Kootenay, from a
tongue of the bench-land made by the
deep gulch of Wild Horse Creek where
it came down from the mountains.  At
their backs rose the huge timbered
foothills of the Rocky Mountains; opposite,
across the vast Kootenay trench, rose the
still mightier foothills of the Selkirks,
and high above the deepening purple of
the forests soared the clear cool azure of
the snows up into the silence of those
sharp-cut Alps, reaching away forever
and forever to north and south against
the roseate translucent afterglow.  Down
yonder the river wandered crimson
through misty prairies, where the trees
stood in clusters pointing up, as the
sentinel stars came one by one on
guard.
</p>

<p>
"Dandy," said the Blackguard, without
stirring, "lend me five dollars."
</p>

<p>
Without comment the little Corporal
took from his breast-pocket a slender roll
of notes, one of which he surrendered.
</p>

<p>
"Five dollars."  The Blackguard took
the crisp paper, spreading it out upon his
knee.  "I was wondering whether there
was anybody in the world who cared five
dollars for me.  Here, take it back&mdash;I
don't want it."
</p>

<p>
"Stick to it, Blackguard,&mdash;stick to it.
You've been fined a month's pay every
month since last December; and I guess
you'll keep up the motion every month
till your time's out&mdash;stick to it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll keep up the motion," said the
Blackguard vindictively.  "I'll get drunk
to-night.  They fine me because they can't
spare me off duty, and because they've
jolly well proved that there isn't a
guard-house in the Territories strong enough to
hold me over night."
</p>

<p>
The Corporal chuckled.  "How about
number five cell at Regina?"
</p>

<p>
"Number five cell be &mdash;&mdash;.  It was nine
months last time."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, La Mancha.  That nine
months sticks in my gizzard.  I ought
to have been punished, not you."
</p>

<p>
"Take off your serge!"  By taking
off the serge jacket which bore his
double chevron as corporal, Dandy could
surrender the protection given by his
rank, and become a plain trooper like
the Blackguard.  The summons was a
challenge to fight.
</p>

<p>
"I'll keep on my serge," said Dandy;
"you're too big, Blackguard."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't talk rot about number five
cell.  Here's Pup La Mancha, my brother,
deserting, and you and me and that fool
Pocock overtaking him at Lane's
stopping-place.  Suppose you let him go,
Shifty Lane reports you at headquarters.
Suppose you don't let him go, you get
my brother, the Pup, a year in the
cells.  Suppose I let him escape and
take his place, I get nine months.
After all, what's nine months?  I shall
be blazing drunk to-night, and maybe
get it again!"
</p>

<p>
"Why can't you behave yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"Why should I, Dandy?  Now you've
got a mother, Dandy, who gets a letter
from you every week.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead Thou me on.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
She's the kindly light, I suppose, but
mine went out.  And you've got a girl,
Dandy, who believes you're a brass saint
with a tin halo, which you're not, and
who loves you except when she happens
to love some other Johnny, which is all
the same thing.  I've been in love, too,
with heaps of girls, two or three at a
time generally, hating each other like so
many Antipopes.  I have a photograph-album&mdash;you've
seen it in my kit-bag&mdash;of
all the girls I ever really loved, except a
small collection which got burnt up in a
hotel fire.  I tried to be good, more or
less, for each of them, except when they
liked me bad; and even now I could be
tolerably straight, with an occasional
holiday to let off steam, if I had somebody
who cared."
</p>

<p>
"I care," said Dandy moodily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you don't count.  You're only a
whiff, a spit, and a damn like a Russian
cigarette."
</p>

<p>
"But you have people&mdash;your family."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I've got a brother in London,
an awful snob,&mdash;also a sister."
</p>

<p>
"La Mancha, I saw the name in some
paper&mdash;the Duke of&mdash;Duke of Something&mdash;Spanish
Ambassador to the Court of
St. James'&mdash;but, Blackguard!"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Is that your"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's the Snob."
</p>

<p>
"But from what I saw he must be an
awful bad lot."
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard's eyes flashed ominously.
"Drop that.  If you talk bad
about my people I'll have to chuck
you into the river.  Then you'll get
wet."
</p>

<p>
"And you'll be sorry.  Are all your
people such swells?"
</p>

<p>
For answer the Blackguard drew
from beneath his undershirt a crucifix
which hung from a slender chain of
gold about his neck.  "That's from
one of my relations,"&mdash;he kissed it
reverently,&mdash;"Isabella&mdash;God bless
her&mdash;of Spain."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Blackguard, are you of the
Blood-Royal&mdash;a prince?"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite that,&mdash;I suppose in English
I should be Lord So-and-so.  Regimental
Number 1107, Constable La Mancha, my
lord&mdash;ahem&mdash;you are charged with having,
on the night of the 18th instant, been
drunk, and assaulted the guard; also with
having, on the night of the same instant,
set the guard-room on fire; also with
having, on the same night, et
cetera.&mdash;  Sounds well,&mdash;eh, Dandy?"
</p>

<p>
The Corporal laughed.  "We've been
together four years now, and this is
the first time you told me a word
about yourself.  We have lots of
gentlemen in the ranks&mdash;I suppose I'm a
gentleman myself if it comes to that,
but"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A fat lot of use it is, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"That's so.  What were you doing all
those years in England?"
</p>

<p>
"Military attaché at the Legation until
I had my last big row with the Snob.
You see, I met a woman at a Foreign
Office reception&mdash;a regular cat&mdash;and
found her out for a she-spy in the
secret service of&mdash;let's say Russia.
When the Snob took to fooling around
after her, I warned him; but he only
thought I was jealous, and called me
names.  So we had a row, and I gave
him a black eye, Eton style.  Then
I had to give him another to make
it even.  After that, of course, all was
over between us.  I took some keys off
him, plundered the safe, told him what
train I should catch, the name of the
steamer&mdash;gave him every chance if he
wanted a public scandal.  He didn't
want a scandal&mdash;might have cost him his
job, so now he's the Ambassador and I'm
the Blackguard.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
"Poor devil!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, poor devil," yawned the Blackguard
cheerfully, as he stood up to
stretch himself.  "Anything fresh?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much."  The Corporal was
brushing some dead grass from his
breeches.  "There's a civilian at the
officers' mess, came from Golden City by
the 'Duchess' and rode over from
Windermere.  He's bound for the Throne
Mine."
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard looked across the
valley and saw one glimmering light far
up on the mountains&mdash;the light of the
Throne Mine.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "I'm off to the
canteen."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool!  Come and play
poker in my tent."
</p>

<p>
"What's the use?"  The Blackguard
laid his hand on Dandy's shoulder.
"You're a good fellow.  I know jolly
well what you mean, but I've got a
devil&mdash;Good-night&mdash;and an appointment with
Mother Darkie."
</p>

<p>
Then the Corporal turned sorrowfully
away.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women and wine and war!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War and wine and love!<br>
  With a sword to wear, and a steed to ride,<br>
  And a wench to love&mdash;give me nought beside,<br>
  But a bottle or so at the eventide:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women and wine and war!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women and wine and war!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War and wine and love!<br>
  Oh, war's my trade, and wine's my play,<br>
  Wine crown the night, and war the day&mdash;<br>
  With a kiss or so in a casual way:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women and wine and war!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women and wine and war!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War and wine and love!<br>
  Here's a broken head, and a drunken spree,<br>
  And the blue-eyed wench deserted me,<br>
  Go! lecture the woman, and let me be:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women and wine and war!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So sang the Blackguard, while all his
riotous gang roared out the chorus, and
Mother Darkness, perched on the bar
with my Lord of Misrule's big arms about
her waist, rocked to and fro, crying
"Lordy!  Lordy!" at intervals.
</p>

<p>
"Boys," said the Blackguard, "who
wouldn't be a soldier at fifty cents a day
and die for a living!"
</p>

<p>
"Shut yer jaw!  Can't you drink,
Blackguard, without making speeches?
Why, the smell of a cork sets you off.
You'd talk the legs off a brass monkey!"
</p>

<p>
"What I say is," shouted Mutiny
Saunders, in hot argument with his chum,
Tribulation Jones,&mdash;"what I sez is, when
a man's got an 'orse and looks after that
'orse, and grooms that 'orse, and gits to
like 'is 'orse, and some 'alf-breed hofficer
wants to take that 'orse away from 'im,
and 'e bucks stiff-legged,&mdash;what I sez is,
'air on 'im!"
</p>

<p>
"Camp on 'is trail!" suggested
Tribulation,&mdash;"make 'is life a burden to 'im.  Oh,
my Gawd, tear a bone out of 'im!  What
do you say, Blackguard?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, keep it till the break of day.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Women and wine and war!'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Eh, Mother Darkness?  Come and be
Mrs. Blackguard.  Boys, celebrate our
nuptials, dance at our wedding, for
Mother Darkness is to be Queen of the
May&mdash;and share my Government straight,
and pay my debts, and take in washing,
and be my wife."
</p>

<p>
He kissed her ugly black face, while
she rocked to and fro muttering "Lordy!
Lordy!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll take a scarecrow in&mdash;I'll have a
bally scarecrow for my wife!" shouted
Billy Boy out of a corner.  "Send round
the poison, Blackguard."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and to the blazes with poverty.
Mother Darkness, my last dollar for the
drinks&mdash;for now I'm clean-busted."
</p>

<p>
So while the drinks went round once
more the Blackguard snatched up his
guitar, and caught the lilt of some grand
old Andalusian dance&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sing with me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carita;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance with me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carita,<br>
  Let the mad world sing the lilt of our gladness!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance with me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carita;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrilie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carita,<br>
  Let the glad earth catch the lilt of our madness!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The log-cabin allowed but space to
swing a cat, as the saying is&mdash;although
nobody had ever swung cats in it since
its erection a month ago.  Kept by a
motherly negress, enterprising in the
matter of illicit whisky, this shanty
served as a canteen for the camp, levied
half the available pay of D Troop,
occasioned more trouble than all the Red
Indians in Kootenay, and generally played
the very deuce with public morals.  As
to the men who sat on soap boxes and
barrels round the walls, or perched on
the bar, giving cheek to Mother Darkness,
well, of course, they should have
been in bed long ago, and certainly they
ought to have abstained from the trash
which passed current at a shilling a drink
for whisky; but then&mdash;the shanty was
by proclamation "out of bounds"; to be
found in it meant a heavy fine; to be
caught beyond the limits of the camp after
"lights out" meant punishment, and to
drink illicit liquor was officially accounted
worse than all the deadly sins; so,
according to the natural history of man, there
was every inducement for a roaring night.
And the men?  To the stature and
strength of an English Life Guardsman
add the intelligence, courage, and
impudence of a Black Watch veteran, and you
have the prescription for a constable of
the North-West Mounted Police.  There
is not in all the Empire a more splendid
corps than this widely-scattered regiment
of irregular cavalry, in time of peace
hare-brained, half-mutinous, almost beyond the
power of human control; in many a time of
instant danger approved for stern endurance,
utter loyalty, and headlong courage.
These men in the shanty, waking the
night with song and chorus, had each of
them done great deeds of arms, for which
nobody in authority or otherwise had
given as much as a "Thank you."  The
tale has been told at many a camp fire,
how a constable was sent once to track
down a mad Indian who had killed and
eaten his children.  Months afterwards
the Officer Commanding at Fort Edmonton
was interrupted in the midst of a
muster parade by a bearded civilian in
rags, who walked up to him and halted
at three paces with a correct salute.
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce do you want?" said
the Officer Commanding.
</p>

<p>
"Come to report, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Who the devil are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Constable Saunders, sir,&mdash;got my
prisoner in the guard-room."
</p>

<p>
That was Mutiny Saunders, who had
tracked his victim fearlessly into goodness
knows what awful recesses of the northern
forest, who had been struck off the
strength of the Force as "missing," but
who never deigned to report himself alive
until he carried out an almost impossible
order and vindicated the majesty of
British Justice by making the most
extraordinary arrest in all the annals of the
Empire.
</p>

<p>
Tribulation Jones, now arguing with
Mutiny about a horse, was one of the
seventy-five men who took part in the
"Poundmaker Racket," when Crozier's
Troop, confronted by thousands of armed
Indians, charged, rode them down,
wheeled, charged again, scattered them
and carried off a necessary prisoner, and
all without a single shot being fired.
</p>

<p>
Billy Boy, now howling out the chant of
"Old King Cole," once drove a team two
hundred and ten miles in two days without
killing his horses, and in the darkest days
of the North-West Rebellion carried
despatches right through the enemy's
lines.
</p>

<p>
Mackinaw Bob, leaning back against
the shanty wall very drunk, was one of
the thirty men who in Fort Walch defied
for three days the largest Indian army
ever raised, to wit, the Sioux forces of
Sitting Bull, when they came to Canadian
territory triumphant after the massacre of
General Custer's 7th Cavalry.
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard?  But the Blackguard's
story is the purport of this
present writing.  He had taken up the
bad old song called "Limerick," of many
naughty verses, strung to an idiotic
tune&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Ho, there was a non-com. at Macleod<br>
  Who got so infernally proud<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he busted his vest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the swell of his chest,<br>
  And they bore him away in a shroud.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yah, there was a recruit at headquarters<br>
  Who loved all the officers' daughters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he couldn't choose which,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So occasioned a hitch,<br>
  And broke all the girls' hearts at headquarters."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Boys, who's this Tenderfoot they've
got at the officers' mess?"
</p>

<p>
"I found the duffer," said one of the
boys just in from Windermere patrol,&mdash;"he'd
strayed like a something Maverick&mdash;didn't
know who he was or where he
belonged to&mdash;lost his led horse with all
his dunnage.  I rounded him up and
headed him in towards camp.  His
name's Ramsay."
</p>

<p>
"Is he any good?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Puts on enough side for a
Governor-General, called me my good
fellah&mdash;the blawsted Henglish jumped-up,
copper-bottomed, second-hand,
brass-bound swine."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he going to sleep?"
</p>

<p>
"Colonel's tent, I guess, unless the
old man turns up unexpected; but he's
still at the mess with a brandy-and-soda
and two blanked adjectived Inspectors.
I want to know what we've done that he
should be palmed off on a white man's
camp instead of old Isadore's Reserve,
the rat-tailed, lop-eared, pigeon-livered
son of a"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Boys, Providence has sent him here
to be kicked, and shall we dispute the
wisdom of Providence?  I'll see to it, you
fellows; and now, unless somebody's got
credit with my future wife for the drinks,
let us close the exercises by singing in a
loud voice the words of that venerable
summons known as the 'General
Salute.'"
</p>

<p>
So the boys took up the goodly measure
to a strenuous accompaniment of beaten
pans in an uproar worthy of Pandemonium&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Now here comes the Gen-e-ral, all venom and spleen,<br>
  And he rides like a sack, with a string round the middle, Oh<br>
  His head's full of fea-thers, and his heart's all woe,<br>
  So 'present' while the band plays 'God save the Queen!'"<br>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "Soldier, soldier, where are your breeches, pray?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldier, soldier, get up and dust;<br>
  Where the deuce have you hidden your brains away?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldier, soldier, get up and dust.<br>
  Busted the bugler?  Send him to hospital;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't you shut up that confounded row?<br>
  Show a leg, and no damned profanity&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out and sweat for a shillin' a day."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When the bugle had concluded making
these remarks, when the echoes of the
hills were calling back their greeting, the
valley stirred under its blanket of mist,
the Alps blushed red to the sun's first
kiss, and the shadows of night ran to
covert among the scented pines.  The
bugler was raking up a fire in front of the
guard-tent with a view to his morning
coffee, the picket was lounging drowsily
home from the horse lines, and from every
tent came sleepy execrations.
</p>

<p>
"Show a leg there!  Get a move on
you!  Who the &mdash;&mdash; told you to tread on
my legs!  Réveille!  Oh, give us a rest;
who said Réveille?"
</p>

<p>
The bugler sounded "Dress!" and
there was a further stirring as though
half the tents would be overthrown.  One
by one the canvas flaps were thrown
open, as men came out with their towels
in search of tin basins generally mislaid.
Then, it seemed but a few minutes afterwards,
the bugler set the brazen tormentor
to his lips to call stables&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, come to the stables and water your horses,<br>
  And groom them a little and give them some hay,<br>
  Groom them damned little and give them bad hay,<br>
  Government grooming and Government hay;<br>
  For if you don't do it the Colonel will know it,<br>
  Then orderly-room&mdash;and the devil to pay."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At that the troop fell in, each man with
his curry-comb and brush, some in canvas
jackets, some without, one or two in deer-skin
coats, all with long boots, and otherwise
compromising their civilian appearance
with traces of uniform, except the
Orderly Sergeant, who wore correct
undress.  He had to bring parade to attention
and call the roll, then, after a smart
numbering off, to give the "Fours right,
quick march!" which sent the column
briskly away to the horse lines.  Half an
hour sufficed to water horses, clean up
bedding, groom and feed, then the beasts
were left in charge of a picket detailed
to herd them to pasture for the day.
The parade was dismissed, and the men
strolled home to their tents thinking
audibly on the subject of breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"Constable La Mancha," the Orderly
Sergeant had been consulting his notes.
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Consider yourself under arrest."
</p>

<p>
"Kiss my socks!" said the Blackguard.
"Why, what have I done?" he continued
innocently.
</p>

<p>
"Done?  You'll find out soon enough."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sergeant&mdash;but which charge in
particular&mdash;I've got to prepare my defence."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, give us a rest!  Get off to
breakfast,&mdash;I'm busy."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas ever thus!" said the Blackguard
sorrowfully.  "Thank goodness,
the Colonel's away."  But even as he
turned abruptly towards the tents a
mounted man coming up from behind
barely avoided riding over him.  "What
d'you think you're doing?" cried the
Blackguard angrily.  The rider swerved
gracefully clear with a touch of the rein,
a hard-featured, clear-eyed veteran, grey
with long service, sitting his horse with
an easy dignity, dressed in rough frontier
clothes, weary, travel-stained&mdash;the
Colonel himself.
</p>

<p>
La Mancha saluted in haste, startling
the horse into a succession of desperate
plunges.  "Just like my luck!" groaned
the Blackguard, and would have gone on
towards the camp fires of his mess, but
the Colonel, alighting now before his tent
on the far side of the parade ground,
called to him, "La Mancha!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir!" the Blackguard ran to the tent.
</p>

<p>
"Just take my horse to the lines,
unsaddle, give him a rub down, then water,
and send my servant."
</p>

<p>
So the Blackguard was busy, and
cursing until long after the breakfast
bugle; but the Colonel, refreshed by
a wash and a hasty change into uniform,
made his way to the table set under an
awning for the officers' mess.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
His kindly grey eyes had noted a
civilian sitting with his two officers at
breakfast, a handsome English youngster,
neatly built but small, perhaps twenty
years old, to judge by the light down of an
incipient moustache; unused to the world,
as might be known from the awkward
self-consciousness of manners; very
green, to judge by the ridiculous
bourgeois attempt at a riding costume.
</p>

<p>
The two Inspectors had risen, big
Fraser Gaye, late of Carrington's Horse
in South Africa, and little Gunby, from
the Kingston Military School.
</p>

<p>
"Good hunting, sir?" asked the one,
but the other was kicking the Englishman
furtively to make him stand up.  "Good-morning,
sir;" he was kicking strenuously,
his face reddened with the exertion,&mdash;"let
me present Mr. Ramsay."
</p>

<p>
"You're welcome, Mr. Ramsay.  Glad
to see you;&mdash;sit down."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel had taken a chair at the
head of the table, observant of Mr. Ramsay,
and smiling with inward laughter.
"Why," he wondered, "must a green
youngster try to hide his ignorance with
a cloak of affectation?  He's speechless
still with a sort of stage fright, so he
pretends a lofty reserved indifference."  "No,"
the Colonel turned suddenly upon
Fraser Gaye, talking to give his guest a
chance of cooling off, "the hunting was
not very good.  June is a bad month when
one has to respect the game laws.  Do
you know what game is always in season,
Mr. Ramsay?"
</p>

<p>
The Colonel's winning smile meant, as
his subalterns knew, the advent of his
very oldest joke.  "No?" for Mr. Ramsay
was still speechless.  "Ah, the kind
of sport I speak of is out of date where
you come from.  Man is the one game
animal never out of season in the
West."
</p>

<p>
"Man?"  Mr. Ramsay had found his
tongue at last; so while the Mess Orderly
was laying breakfast before him, the
Colonel went on reassured&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  My Division has been sent
across the Rockies here into British
Columbia because the Kootenay tribes
have been a little restive.  There was
a medicine man from somewhere in Idaho
at the bottom of all the trouble, and he
being an American subject, I was not
willing to risk the loquacity of the
newspapers yonder.  To arrest him meant
worry and red tape without end."
</p>

<p>
"What, sir?" the senior Subaltern
spoke anxiously.  "Have you"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No," the Colonel smiled over his
coffee cup, "I went as a civilian; as a
civilian I herded him like a steer across
the Tobacco Plains, and left him in gaol
under a bogus charge in United States
territory.  That's my hunting, gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel had given his guest time
enough to shake off any embarrassment;
indeed, the youngster had by this time
helped himself uninvited to a second rasher
of bacon, put on an air of assured worldliness,
and was evidently trying to assume
the easy devil-may-care freedom of manners
which he supposed to be characteristic of
the Far West.
</p>

<p>
"A little more bacon?" said the Colonel
gracefully, with a wink towards his senior
Inspector.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;thanks&mdash;yes&mdash;I mean I've
helped myself."  The Tenderfoot was
blushing to the roots of his hair.
</p>

<p>
"I hope my young gentlemen have
been entertaining you properly?"
continued the Colonel, at which the junior
Inspector burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
"We've tried, sir."  Mr. Fraser Gaye
met an inquiring glance from the Colonel.
"We gave this gentleman your tent, with
some of our bedding; but when he tried
to turn in last night he fell foul of one of
the Quartermaster's sheep lashed to the
cot.  Mr. Ramsay says he was kicked
half-way across the parade ground."
</p>

<p>
"I must say," the Colonel tried to be
grave, "I had some misgivings when
I met La Mancha just now.  He wore
that eager-child innocence of expression
which always means some fresh outrage.
I promise you, Mr. Ramsay, that he shall
have occasion to repent."
</p>

<p>
"Aw&mdash;I wouldn't be hard on him, don't
you know.  I'm sure it was only"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Englishman was genuine now, so
that despite his airs and graces the Colonel
liked him.  Even the mess waiter, standing
with a wooden face behind, allowed a
glance to escape of intelligent appreciation,
and the senior Inspector, noting it, was
glad that news of this plea for mercy
would reach the troop.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel changed the subject.
"Well, Mr. Ramsay, how do you like
our mountains?"
</p>

<p>
Again the Tenderfoot fell into needless
embarrassment, until little Gunby came
to his relief.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ramsay turned up last night, sir,
on horseback."  The Subaltern could not
refrain from grinning at the remembrance.
"He's got business up at the Throne
Camp, so I took the liberty of promising"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A man to show him the way, eh?
Quite right.  Mr. Ramsay is welcome.
Who's Orderly Officer?  Oh!  Then
Mr. Fraser Gaye will detail a good
man&mdash;and now"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Colonel rose, seeming scarcely to
have taken more than a cup of coffee, and
with a glance drew the senior Subaltern to
his own tent, where he received a full
report of events during his late absence.
</p>

<p>
"Get rid of that young fool," was his
last instruction before closing the
interview.  "If you let him stay in camp
another day I shall have to punish half
the men for practical jokes.  Get rid of
him before noon."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Come to your mother, my love,<br>
  Come to your mother, my boy."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Defaulters Call</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Regimental Number 1107, Constable
la Mancha," the Colonel read from a sheet
of blue foolscap, "you are charged with
having, on the night of the 2nd instant,
been drunk."
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You are further charged with having,
on the same instant, acted contrary to the
discipline of the Force, in that you did
cruelly ill-treat an animal&mdash;namely, a
sheep."
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You are further charged with having
used insulting and abusive language to
the Sergeant of the Guard."
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard smiled.  "I told him to"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" said the Sergeant-Major
quietly.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel laid down the charge-sheet
with a gesture of weariness.
</p>

<p>
"Have you anything to say for yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"It's all correct, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You have no excuse or apology?"
</p>

<p>
"None, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Constable la Mancha, are you aware
that your defaulter sheet is notoriously
the blackest in the Force?"
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard answered with a smile
of innocent frankness which would have
disarmed a grizzly bear.
</p>

<p>
"In four months from now your time
expires, otherwise, for continuous
misbehaviour, I should be compelled to
recommend your discharge.  I cannot
have my whole division demoralised by
one"&mdash;he was going to say
"blackguard!"  "Consider this matter.  Fined
one month's pay."
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard saluted.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Right about turn," said the Sergeant-Major,
"quick march."
</p>

<p>
Then the Colonel chuckled.  Presently
he looked up at the senior Inspector.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen to Mr. Ramsay?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid, sir, that I have only one
duty man available who knows the trail."
</p>

<p>
"You mean La Mancha?  Hum!&mdash;I
wish we had a dozen men as useful.
Well, never mind the rules&mdash;he's safer
occupied."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector spoke to the Orderly
Sergeant, who left the tent saluting.
</p>

<p>
"Blackguard," he said, overtaking the
culprit, "got a job for you.  Saddle your
horse and Polly.  You're to take that
Tenderfoot up to the Throne Mine.
Report before lights out to-morrow, and
see you don't 'mislay him' anywhere."

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
An hour later, when the sun was high in
the heavens, Mr. Ramsay, attended by a
"common soldier," set out in state
westward for the Selkirk Mountains.  The
Englishman's feelings were mixed, firstly
with admiration for the common soldier's
ease in the saddle, for his coal-black
charger, standing sixteen hands, clumsy
as a dray-horse, the one weight-carrying
animal in D Division, for the belt weighed
down at one side with a ponderous service
revolver, and glittering all across his back
with twenty cartridges of burnished brass
like a serpent of golden fire.  His second
feeling was pride at being sent out with
such an escort, for the Blackguard on
horseback was magnificent.  His third
feeling was poignant humiliation over
what had passed when, in presence of a
dozen grinning troopers, he had tried to
mount the gentle brown mare at the lines.
</p>

<p>
"If you will mount on the off side,"
was La Mancha's stinging comment,
"she'll kick off your head to begin with."
</p>

<p>
Then somebody had made a remark
about his riding-breeches, which came
from the most expensive tailor in London.
"Why, you idiot, they're for swimming.
Don't you see the baggy parts blow like
footballs to keep the duffer afloat?"  He
had not caught some further remarks
about his leggings, but a chill went up
his back at the thought of it.  All across
the continent he had looked in vain for
such baggy riding-breeches, such leather
leggings, such loud-checked tweed as his
tailor had insisted upon in Conduit Street.
Such things were not worn in Canada.
</p>

<p>
But now, away from the atmosphere of
that camp, in which he had scarcely dared
to breathe, away from the troopers who
had looked upon him as a sort of penny
toy, and the officers who had failed to see
how much he needed rest after yesterday's
ride, Mr. Ramsay felt that he must shake
off his diffidence.
</p>

<p>
They had reached the river, and, as the
Blackguard slacked rein in mid-stream to
let the big horse drink, Mr. Ramsay did
the same, not observing that he had
halted his animal so far forward that
the water went down muddy and foul for
the other.  The Blackguard favoured him
with a glance of some virulence, and went
on a little.  On the far bank there was
more humiliation&mdash;dismounting to recinch
the saddles after the western custom, the
shortening of his own stirrup leathers,
then the mounting, this time a little
better done.
</p>

<p>
"Blackguard," said Mr. Ramsay,
meaning to be distantly affable, as
became their social relations; but the
soldier looked round to favour him with
a prolonged stare.  Then, drawing a
deep breath&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If you want to call me, don't trouble
to speak, just whistle&mdash;so"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
At the whistle a dog came leaping out
from some bushes by the river.  "Why,
it's Powder!  Come along, then, dear old chap!"
</p>

<p>
So for some time, while they paced
slowly over the meadows and climbed the
high bench beyond, the common soldier
and the dog made perfect company, while
the Tenderfoot rode behind full of bitterness.
</p>

<p>
"My good man," he said at last,
irritably, drawing abreast, "the day
before yesterday I left Windermere on
horseback&mdash;I'd never been on the back of
a horse in all my life."
</p>

<p>
"So I see;" said the Blackguard,
glancing over the other with scorching
criticism.
</p>

<p>
"I was frightened to death, but whatever
you think of me I can keep my
cowardice to myself."
</p>

<p>
"So I observe.  Sure sign of a
thoroughbred!" said the Blackguard
gravely.  "Now, if you pick up Powder
by the tail, he won't let out a whimper."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ramsay looked at the animal,
which was piebald red and white like
a cow, exhibited in its person symptoms
of about eighteen different kinds of dog,
and had not the slightest vestige of a tail,
not even a bud.  The Tenderfoot tried to
be freezingly polite.
</p>

<p>
"Fit for the Dogs' Home, I should think."
</p>

<p>
"No," said the Blackguard, "he's
very rare&mdash;thoroughbred of his kind&mdash;the
only known specimen.  He's getting
sick of this expedition already.  Go you
home, Powder!"
</p>

<p>
Powder, assuming an expression of
disdain, hopped off languidly on three legs.
</p>

<p>
"He's official dog to D Troop,"
explained the Blackguard; "draws his
rations out of the hindquarters of every
civilian dog within ten miles."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ramsay took a case from his
pocket, and with much gravity and
puppyish affectation drew out a cigar,
which, with vigorous balancing in the
saddle, he managed to light, throwing
the flaming match beside the trail.
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard, greatly amused, pulled
up, dismounted, quenched an incipient fire
with his foot, then, swinging easily into
the saddle, remarked upon certain penalties
for setting the country alight.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ramsay maintained a scornful
silence.  Neither this, nor the distant
affability, nor the freezing politeness had
been quite a success, but there was still a
trace of condescension in his voice when
he remarked experimentally upon the
shot-gun slung in place of a carbine on
the horn of La Mancha's saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my good fellow, what kind of
shooting do you expect?"
</p>

<p>
"Side-hill hens," the Blackguard waxed
serious.
</p>

<p>
"What are they?  We have none at home."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, in this mountain country the
prairie chickens have one leg shorter than
the other, so that they can graze along the
slopes."
</p>

<p>
"But then, they could only go one
way!  It sounds like nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"Quite true, though; they keep to the
right.  I'll show you their notice-boards
presently.  Then higher up we may get a
few chiffons, or a brace of fichus."
</p>

<p>
"I never heard of your local game.
Very inferior sport, I should suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The chiffon is only a four-legged
bird&mdash;grows fur and teeth."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, you mean it's an animal?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;plain bird.  And the fichu is more
curious still.  We only get hen birds now,
because the cock birds are all extinct."
</p>

<p>
"Aw&mdash;nonsense!  How could they breed?"
</p>

<p>
"They don't," said the Blackguard sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
By this time Mr. Ramsay was full of
misgivings, but gaining the top of the
bench-land, the Blackguard led off at a
trot which soon shook not only misgivings
out of the Tenderfoot, but also several
vital organs, and even one or two
distinctly profane remarks when he lost the
cigar.  He was so sore after yesterday's
travelling that every jerk spelt agony,
and nothing but courage withheld him
from crying aloud.
</p>

<p>
"Sore tail, eh?" said La Mancha at
last, and, loosing rein, let his horse break
into a fresh pace, the delightfully easy
canter known in the west as a "lope."  "Is
that better?"
</p>

<p>
"Haw!  I could keep this up all day.
You need not consider me."
</p>

<p>
So they went on across the gently
rolling grass land, past many a graceful
thorp of pines and bluff of tremulous
aspen, through meadow lands ablaze
with big yellow daisies and swaying acres
bright with golden rod.  The air was rich
with perfume from the woods, where unseen
birds rang out ecstatic songs; canaries
flaunted their gorgeous hues from branch
to branch, and humming-birds whirring
each like an emerald in his mist of wings
over the blossoms of rich scented briar.
Great gardens of wild roses mile by mile,
steeped with intoxicating perfume, then
cedars towering out of the dreamy heat,
then of a sudden they entered a green
twilight of forest, cool, still, mysterious,
like some ghostly sea where coral red
along the misty aisles great trees went
up into a cloud of leaves.  So the
Blackguard drew rein as though it were
irreverent to canter into church, and mile
after mile the trail went upward into the
shadow, steeper and steeper as they neared
the hills.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the green gloaming parted
ahead, framing the blue haze of an abrupt
mountain; then, as though out of some
submarine cavern, the riders came into
an open glade at the very base of the
Selkirk range, where the afternoon sun
half-blinded them.  On either hand steep
wooded heights shot up into mid-sky&mdash;between
them a winding meadow barred
just ahead with a great snake fence, save
where there came forth a rumbling stream,
milk-white because it had sprung full-grown
from the mills of the gods&mdash;from
the far-away glacier of the Throne.
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard let out a long "halloo,"
answered at once by a rifle shot; and the
Tenderfoot was just in time to see a whiff
of blue smoke against the big snake
fence.
</p>

<p>
"Two cowboys in camp," explained
the Blackguard as they rode forward;
"they've made the fence to corrall old
General Buster's bulls."
</p>

<p>
"Aw&mdash;a pretty rough lot, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Be civil, or they'll eat you," the
Blackguard grinned; "they always shoot
at sight unless you halloo their password.
That's why I yelped.  They're cannibals
too.  Have you much money on you?
Well, it's too late to save it now&mdash;so hope
for the best."
</p>

<p>
Thus prejudiced against the cowboys,
Mr. Ramsay found their appearance
displeasing.  Both men wore blue shirts
with large pearl buttons arranged in a
shield pattern on the breast, and heavy
leather "chaparejos" leggings, suspended
from a revolver belt; one pair with leather
fringes all down the outer seam, the other
completely faced with the hairy black
bearskin.  Black Bear was a swarthy
Mexican, ominously scowling, and adorned
with large gold earrings; Leather, who
answered to the uncouth name Arrapahoe
Bill, was a lengthy hard fair
sinner, whose tawny hair curled down well
over his neck.
</p>

<p>
"Ho-la, the blackguard!" was Black
Bear's greeting, followed by a torrent in
guttural Spanish, while the horses were
being rapidly unsaddled and turned loose
to graze within the fence.  As to Arrapahoe
Bill, one glance at the Tenderfoot's
baggy breeches reduced him to ominous
silence.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Bill&mdash;how's tricks?" said the
Blackguard afterwards, lying at ease
before the tent, while he watched the
Mexican's cookery of coffee and venison.
</p>

<p>
"Tricks?" growled Arrapahoe Bill,
pointing at Mr. Ramsay,&mdash;"where did you
get <i>that</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let me introduce you,&mdash;this is
Mr. Ramsay from&mdash;Clapham Junction."
</p>

<p>
"How do?" said the cowboy stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Bill," the Blackguard seemed
amused, "a cheerful specimen you are,
you confounded old grizzly.  Wake up
and be civil."
</p>

<p>
"Mistah Ramsay from Clapham Junction,"
said the cowboy with difficulty, as
though his tongue was stiff, "there ain't
no civility whar I come from, but white
men are always welcome, sah, among
gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
"I am not, as you suppose, from
Clapham Junction," said the Tenderfoot,
thinking thus to mitigate the situation,
"but&mdash;thanks all the same," he added
lamely.
</p>

<p>
"Mistah Ramsay," continued the
Blackguard, with a malicious grin, "is
an English capitalist going up to see the
Throne Mine."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" the Mexican chuckled with a
snarling laugh, "the outfit of the Throne
Mine is gone <i>loco</i>."
</p>

<p>
"That means," explained La Mancha,
"that the people at the Throne are lunatics."
</p>

<p>
"Really?"
</p>

<p>
"All yesterday they fire off guns&mdash;they
have a <i>fiesta</i>.  Then followed another
torrent of guttural Spanish.
</p>

<p>
"A birthday party," explained La
Mancha.  "'Ware petticoats!  It seems
that they've got a woman up there&mdash;the
Burrows girl, they call her; arrived since
I was this way before."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," suggested the Tenderfoot
stiffly, "Mr. Burrows has a niece or a
daughter."
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, she's a good-looking piece,
by all accounts.  Wish I'd been up there
for the birthday,&mdash;I like girls."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Mr. Tenderfoot."  Arrapahoe
Bill was cleaning his sheath knife by
stabbing it into the earth.  "Soldier,
the kettle's a-boil.  Sling in that coffee."
</p>

<p>
The soldier slung coffee and sugar into
the camp kettle, let it boil a minute, then
served the scalding stuff into four tin cups.
Meanwhile Black Bear was busy filling
four tin plates with a stew of reindeer.
So the meal commenced, for three
ravenous frontiersmen and one doubtful
Britisher who had never before tasted
venison, nor knew what manner of beast
had furnished it.
</p>

<p>
"More girl deer," said the Black Bear
in his dubious English.
</p>

<p>
"More what?"  The Tenderfoot cast
a glance of extreme suspicion at the stew.
</p>

<p>
"Dear girl, he means," explained the
Blackguard,&mdash;"dear little Indian girl shot
yesterday."
</p>

<p>
The Englishman, ghastly white, got up,
clutching his breast with both hands, and
walked away with great dignity into the
woods.
</p>

<p>
"'Ware rattlesnakes!" shouted Arrapahoe
Bill, with a grim chuckle; and
then, knowing that the victim of this
awful jest was beyond all fear of snakes,
the three men laughed.  Yet even while
the Blackguard relished the flavour of the
joke came its bitter aftertaste, which froze
the grin on his face and made him follow
Mr. Ramsay.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he said, coming to where
his charge leaned shaking against a tree,
"don't be a fool!  That dish, my Emerald,
was venison, the meat of the cariboo,
of the reindeer.  You know what venison is?"
</p>

<p>
The Englishman turned slowly, looking
over his shoulder with a glance of scorn
and rage.  "I know what you are," he
said in a low even voice,&mdash;"I know what
you are now."
</p>

<p>
"A blackguard, yes, I know.  And
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;you needn't make such a
fuss about it."
</p>

<p>
The Englishman turned full upon him,
quite quiet, though the sweat stood upon
his forehead in white drops.  "I am a
Tenderfoot&mdash;you laugh at me&mdash;think I'm
afraid of you. I don't know your ways
here, but I've read of them in books.
There is one thing in common between us
two.  Will you fight?"
</p>

<p>
"No,&mdash;you're too small."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean with fists.  Go and
borrow for me a revolver from those
friends of yours&mdash;you have your own."
</p>

<p>
"You're a brave man," said the Blackguard,
bantering, "but you see, my dear
fellow, I can't fight, because my business
is to keep you out of mischief."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't try to shuffle out of it
now&mdash;fetch that revolver."
</p>

<p>
"Little stranger, I am a dead shot, I
have killed men&mdash;worse luck&mdash;before now;
while you never fired a gun in all your
life."
</p>

<p>
"I choose your own weapons, you coward!"
</p>

<p>
"Little man, over all this country,
from sea to sea, there's a flag"&mdash;the
Blackguard took off his hat&mdash;"which does
not allow any nonsense.  We're not in
the United States just now.  I beg your
pardon, I, Don José Santa Maria
Sebastian Iago las Morẽnas de la Mancha,
otherwise known as the Blackguard, beg
your pardon.  Come, don't be a silly ass!"
</p>

<p>
It was not what La Mancha said, nor
the grace with which he spoke, the certain
scornful simplicity as of a great aristocrat,
which moved the Englishman.  Rather it
was the wonderful tender light in the
man's eyes.
</p>

<p>
Ramsay's hand went out instinctively,
and the two men were friends.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
"Do you know my side of life&mdash;London?"
asked the Tenderfoot haughtily, as he
followed La Mancha by a corkscrew trail
up the lower foothills.
</p>

<p>
"Rather," said the Blackguard,&mdash;"the
mare's a great pal of mine."
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Lord</i> Mayor, I suppose, you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"No, the grey mare&mdash;horse's old
woman, you know.  Besides, I know the
place well.  The Grand Trunk passes
through it; there's quite a station."
</p>

<p>
"Why, hundreds of lines go to London."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know about hundreds.
There's the Grand Trunk, and perhaps
they carry a line of portmanteaux or
hat-boxes.  But I always take the Grand
Trunk.  More commodious.  Besides,
one has to have a lot of clothes for a big
place like London; it has ten thousand
people."
</p>

<p>
"Five millions, you mean."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come off; there are not that
number in the whole of Ontario, or
Canada, for that matter."
</p>

<p>
"London, Ontario?  But I was talking
of the real London."
</p>

<p>
"I see; another place, I suppose, of
the same name&mdash;called after it, most likely.
Oh yes, I know, of course."
</p>

<p>
The Tenderfoot raged furiously.
</p>

<p>
"All right, keep on your shirt," said
the Blackguard; "I'll be quite serious if
you like.  Yes, I know Town&mdash;lots of
relations there."
</p>

<p>
"What name?" asked the Tenderfoot
innocently.  "Where do they live?"
</p>

<p>
"All over the place&mdash;different branches
of the family, you know, but you can
always tell them by their coat-of-arms&mdash;the
Medici arms, three golden globes
and a side door.  They're mostly uncles."
</p>

<p>
In spite of himself, Mr. Ramsay
laughed.  "I know them.  What made
you say I came from Clapham Junction?"
</p>

<p>
"Where do you live, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Balham."
</p>

<p>
"I was only two miles wrong, my
friend; it's written on you."
</p>

<p>
"Written on me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it will rub off in time, that brand
of the respectable suburbs.  Good old
southern suburbs!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what you mean, but you
know your London."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Tenderfoot, but not <i>your</i> London.
Mine was the jolly old London of dress
rehearsals, actors' dressing-rooms, suppers
at Salviati's, a brake for the Derby,
Tattersall's,  Lord's, Sunday at
Richmond, Monday with the Vagabonds, at
the House, in the Night Club, in the
Row, in Mayfair, in Whitechapel, on the
River, in the Bucket Shop, up the Spout,
or the deuce knows where."
</p>

<p>
"I never saw that London," said the
Tenderfoot gravely.
</p>

<p>
"What was your London, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the City, the City all day, and
for my sins Exeter Hall, because my
father's that sort of man; and in the
evenings, parlour games, lawn tennis,
parties,&mdash;my mother's that kind of woman;
lecturing on minerals at the Polytechnics,
debating at the mock Parliament, slumming
in Southwark.  Lord, how sick I was of
it all&mdash;oh, how sick and tired!  But now
these woods, this life, if I could only
understand,&mdash;meeting men, real men like
you, with bodies instead of only souls."
</p>

<p>
"Poor little beggar!  Yet I suppose
there were things you liked even in your
London?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, cycling, boating, the debates,
the lecturing, thinking, reading, finding
out things.  After all, it's a wonderful
place, the centre of everything, the middle
of the whole world."
</p>

<p>
"Give me the outside edge," said the
Blackguard, "the jumping-off place
where you look out into the dark
occasionally, and catch a glimpse of heaven
or hell through the window."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds like poetry."
</p>

<p>
"And it feels like life.  I've never read
a book, but I've lived&mdash;you bet, I've lived!
Great gods, it's better than books; it's
better than London, as you'll see when
you get to live.  You don't understand
things yet.  You don't know what it is
to be in danger, to feel your heart jump
with excitement, to feel your blood dance
at the order to fire, to kill men, to be
shot at.  I used to like a bull feast once
in Spain, but that's tame; to fight in our
insurrections&mdash;that was better.  Even a
dead nation must have a little fun, and
so, because we're not strong enough to
fight our neighbours, we have comical
insurrections among ourselves.  We are
quite bloodthirsty, and some people
really get hurt.  But there's not even
that these last few years.  Poor old
Spain!  Once she was mistress of the
earth, once we Spaniards lived for war
and wine and love, and had it all until
we were satisfied.  Now there are one or
two live Spaniards like me, but to live as
our fathers lived we have to serve under
another flag.
</p>

<p>
"When you wake up, when you've
forgotten all about that infernal old
Balham, you'll see that there's another
London, the centre of the Empire, which
has stolen the fire from heaven that once
belonged to Spain.  We're making that
Empire, we cowboys and miners, magistrates
and mounted police of the frontier,&mdash;making
the new empire in Australia, in
Canada, in Africa, in India.  That's what
it means, the frontier which you've been
trying, after your little Balham way, to
live in these last few days."  Then the
Blackguard relapsed into a shamefaced
chuckle.  "By Jove, I didn't think I had
it in me.  I'm going to preach to the
boys when I get back to camp.  I'll
make 'em sit up, and if they laugh I'll
punch their heads till they're sick."
</p>

<p>
The hillside was clothed beneath the
pines with a dense wet jungle of rotting
deadfall, fruit bushes gorgeous with
blossom, and the immense leaves poised
on viciously barbed stems of the
devil-club.  After climbing for a very long
time, the riders came to the brow of this
lowest spur of the mountains, from
whence the trail wound on through big
timber for many a weary mile, gently
rising save where there was an occasional
abrupt slope to be surmounted.  The top
of the ridge was a gigantic stairway, and
it was sundown before the Tenderfoot
and his guide came to the base of the
upper foothills.
</p>

<p>
"I say," said the Tenderfoot, as they
breathed their horses before breasting the
zig-zag trail up this mountain,&mdash;"I've
been too much ashamed to say anything,
but will these people at the Throne mind
my coming without any luggage?"
</p>

<p>
"They won't mind, if you don't."
</p>

<p>
"I set off from Windermere driving a
pack-horse in front of me."
</p>

<p>
"I see, and the horse went back to
Windermere?  They'll send it along with
the mail or our next patrol.  I'll tell
Grab-a-root, the Quartermaster."
</p>

<p>
"I say, you've rum names in this
country&mdash;Grab-a-root, Dandy, Mutiny,
Tribulation, Arrapahoe Bill, The
Blackguard.  Does everybody have a nickname?"
</p>

<p>
"No; only men who are pretty well
liked&mdash;or hated."
</p>

<p>
"Have I one?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're only a Tenderfoot,&mdash;you
don't count."
</p>

<p>
The youngster sighed.  "They called
me Charlie at home; but here&mdash;I see now."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old Charlie!"
</p>

<p>
"And Mr. Burrows up yonder?"
</p>

<p>
"The Lunatic, eh?  We must be getting on."
</p>

<p>
"Is it very far?" the lad sighed pitifully.
</p>

<p>
"A mile or two.  Come on."
</p>

<p>
The big timber insensibly gave place
to pines scattering up the slope of
ever-lessening girth and stature, sharp, slender
cones, black like funeral torches.  It
seemed ten weary miles to the top of this
upper foothill.  The summit was a
desolate moor, streaked with snow in its
hollows, stony, with patches of grassy
swamp and scattered torches twisted in
uncouth torture, very small, yet looming
monstrous against the waning light.
Ahead was a stony ridge speckled with
juniper bushes, and on its brow two spots
like jutting rocks.
</p>

<p>
"Look," said the Blackguard, pointing
to a tiny glimmer under one of these
spots; "they're lighting their lamp at
the Throne."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
THE Burrows girl was sitting on a soap
box outside the Throne cabin.  Supper
was over, the dishes were just washed
up, her uncle sat within reading a book
of mathematics, so the Burrows girl
could enjoy the cool solitude of the hills
watching the afterglow.  She knew she
was ruddy, sunburned, and freckled; she
also knew that the effect was rather
becoming, that week by week her dainty
beauty was budding steadily with
considerable prospect of real loveliness,&mdash;all
of which gave very good cause for
contentment.  As yet man had not appeared
in her paradise, because so far a month's
observation had convinced her that none
of the neighbouring prospectors were
sufficiently young to count.  At school
she had been three times in love with
men seen distantly in church or street,
but these had all gone blindly by, and
were probably fools.  Now, according to
all her text-books, which were mostly
novels, to every maid there comes in time
a man.  This man takes himself seriously
as a lord of creation, but is really not at
all so formidable as he looks, being a
vulnerable creature, prone to make an
ass of himself on the smallest provocation
from a woman.  The greater the lord of
creation, the more abject his enslavement,
the more complete the conquest.  There
was one story about a young lad, called
Una, leading a growling lion around with
a string.
</p>

<p>
"I want my lion to be very growly
indeed," said the Burrows girl to the
stars; whereat the stars, seeing two
young men toiling painfully up the trail,
began to wink.
</p>

<p>
"Why," said the Burrows girl, "there's
something moving yonder.  Two men, I
declare, on horseback, coming up to the
cabin.  Uncle!" she called,&mdash;"Uncle!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear?"  An elderly man
in a velveteen jacket came lounging to
the door and stood against the lamplight.
</p>

<p>
"Visitors, Uncle!  Oh, bother!"
continued the Burrows girl fretfully; "they'll
be wanting supper."
</p>

<p>
"The duties of hospitality," said the
man sententiously, "must"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, drat the duties!  You never have
to wash up."  Then, to appease him:
"I don't want any company, Uncle&mdash;except
you.  I wonder who are they?
Not prospectors, anyway.  The big one
looks like a soldier."
</p>

<p>
"Mounted police."
</p>

<p>
"And the little one?" she spoke under
her breath.  "'In this style three and
sixpence,'&mdash;I've seen lots like him; but
the big one is 'positively thrown away at
a guinea.'"
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
"Same to you," said the big man,
reining up close before the cabin.  "I
had orders to deliver this package with
the talking end up."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Burrows, I think," said the little
man, drawing nearer.  "My name's
Ramsay, and my father asked me to
deliver this letter of introduction."
</p>

<p>
"What!  From Augustus Ramsay &amp;
Co.?  This is indeed fortunate.
Welcome; most heartily welcome,
Mr. Ramsay.  Let me present to you my
niece, Miss Violet."
</p>

<p>
For some minutes the Blackguard sat
his horse impatient, holding Ramsay's
rein while compliments flew thick&mdash;Balham
compliments, bourgeois civilities.
He was the "common soldier" once
more, Ramsay's soldier-servant from the
Burrows' point of view.  Then the girl
came to him, rather ashamed, he thought,
asked him to "get down," hoped he was
not very tired, led him off to a shed
which served for a stable, showed him
the water-hole, the oats, the lantern, the
compressed hay, and finally ran off to
light up her kitchen stove for a second
supper.
</p>

<p>
"She's almost a lady," thought the
Blackguard, while he groomed and
watered and fed the exhausted horses.
</p>

<p>
Within the cabin Mr. Burrows was
holding forth while his niece laid the
table.  From his talk one would have
supposed that he spoke from some
rostrum, possibly from a throne.
</p>

<p>
"Look at me," he said majestically,&mdash;"do
I look like a fool?"
</p>

<p>
The Tenderfoot blushed.
</p>

<p>
"Answer this.  Does my appearance
suggest insanity?"
</p>

<p>
The Tenderfoot went on blushing.
</p>

<p>
"These ignorant prospectors have
given forth to the whole neighbourhood
that because my methods of mining differ
from theirs, I am nothing better than a
lunatic."
</p>

<p>
"I should think that you would treat
them with silent contempt."
</p>

<p>
"I do, young man,&mdash;I do treat them
with silent contempt.  Why, only the
other day I asked one of them what he
meant by&mdash;&mdash;; but, pshaw, I can afford to
overlook what they mean.  After all,
these prospectors only reflect the greater
world outside, which ever has resented
improvements, and looked upon the
inventor as a public enemy.  It was thus
with Galileo, Watt, Stephenson,
Faraday&mdash;contempt, disparagement, starvation,
while they lived; then, when they died
of want, a commemorative statue.  For
my part, I desire no statue which
commemorates rather the littleness of the
living than the greatness of the dead.  I
overlook such small considerations; they
are beneath my notice.  What did you
say, Violet?  Supper?  Ah!&mdash;a second
supper.  This mountain air has the
advantage of being conducive to a second
supper.  I entirely approve of mountain
air.  Draw up, young man, to the table."
</p>

<p>
So they began to eat bacon and beans,
the Lunatic discoursing monotonously,
the Tenderfoot exchanging first flirtation
signals with the Burrows girl, as she
waited on them, while the Blackguard
just outside splashed cumbrously over a
tin basin and a model brickbat of
scrubbing soap.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  Mr. Burrows sighed over his
second helping, which left seemingly but
a scanty remainder for the big hungry
man outside.  "These considerations of
diet, my young friend,"&mdash;and so on.
</p>

<p>
With a last wrench at the roller towel,
which he had puffed over and blown into
with great satisfaction, the Blackguard
rolled down the sleeves of his grey
undershirt, wished inwardly that he had brought
a jacket, since he was to be the guest of
a woman, and strode with loud-clanking
spurs across the doorstep.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Constable," said Lunatic Burrows
indifferently, "I had forgotten.  I hope
Miss Burrows has reserved some supper
for you in the kitchen."
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard's face looked black
and threatening as he drew up his
shoulders, his head almost touching the
beams.  "I only came in," he said
haughtily, "to tell this youngster not
to trouble about the horses&mdash;I've seen to
them."
</p>

<p>
"I've kept your supper in the oven,"
said Miss Burrows anxiously.  "You'll
forgive us for beginning without you?"
</p>

<p>
La Mancha bowed stiffly, but his eyes
were tender at once when he saw the
girl's real courtesy.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you'll excuse me, Miss
Burrows.  Fact is, I have friends at the
Tough Nut Claim who want me to stay
over night."  Then he turned to her
Uncle: "You needn't disturb yourself,
Burrows."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes&mdash;certainly&mdash;very proper, I'm
sure.  Your friends at the Tough Nut
will"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"For shame, Uncle," cried the girl
indignantly; and the Tenderfoot stood up.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you'll excuse me too, Mr. Burrows,
if I say good-night.  I'm going
with my friend."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Burrows turned to him in speechless
astonishment, but the Blackguard
came at once to the rescue.  "Sit down
again, youngster," he said gently;
"we'll make a man of you yet.  Good-night,
Miss Burrows; good-night,
youngster; so-long, Burrows,&mdash;see you
again in the morning."
</p>

<p>
Then he turned on his heel and walked out.
</p>

<p>
"I think it's too bad," said the girl;
"I never felt so shamed in all my life."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, you see," drawled Lunatic
Burrows, with a sigh of relief.  "A few
more beans, Mr. Ramsay&mdash;just a few more."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Why, that's Mr. La Mancha."
</p>

<p>
"La Mancha&mdash;is that the Blackguard?"  Miss
Burrows went to the
door, looking out into the clear starlight
on the hills.  "I've heard of him.  They
say he's a tremendous swell.  What a
splendid man!"
</p>

<p>
"A swell?" drawled Mr. Burrows,
awakening as though from some dream.
"Dear, dear, you really ought to have
warned me.  It's all your fault, Violet.
How was I to know?  Run after him&mdash;bring
him back at once."
</p>

<p>
Miss Violet turned her back on him,
and went off to the kitchen.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
Just behind the Burrows' cabin the
ground fell away with startling abruptness.
There were just two or three juniper
bushes and a patch of dirty snow, then
the rough edge&mdash;then space.  One looked
down almost terrified into a blue mist;
and full three thousand feet below were
the tops of big pine trees in another
climate&mdash;almost in another world.
Opposite there rose another granite precipice,
smooth, grey, gigantic, the valley
between reaching away on the right,
round a bend, to the meadow where
Arrapahoe Bill and Black Bear guarded
their bulls.
</p>

<p>
On the left was the head of the gorge,
with its glacier breaking over a cliff, and
the broken river, roaring down the wall,
fell into a lake deep blue as the very sky.
This was the Throne glacier, the seat of
what seemed like a chair, with the lake
at its feet, the enormous cliffs on either
side for arms, the back an Alp, ice-clad,
but splintering upward into needle
spires, now touched with the roseate
glow of sunrise.
</p>

<p>
All along the westward sky glimmered
the awakening summits of the Selkirks;
eastwards, across the Kootenay trench,
the Rocky Mountains hung like a belt of
azure mist against the sunrise; but La
Mancha, sitting on the verge of that
huge precipice behind the cabins, took no
thought of the day or of the morrow.
A little wreath of smoke rose straight up
from his pipe into the thin air, and the
awful magnificence of the Alps had no
existence for him while he thought of a
woman.  Her face was before him in a
dream&mdash;the face of a sweet maid, bright
with impudence, a wholesome nut-brown
maiden innocent.  Her innocence made
the Blackguard want to protect her; the
frank brown eyes made him desirous of
study, that in their depths he might see
what it was to be good.  The Blackguard
had tasted all the joys of life, save
this one thing&mdash;purity.  The aftertaste
of pleasure was sour upon his lips, but
happiness seemed yet ever so far away.
"If I were only good," he said to his
pipe, "but I'm not; wherefore she would
find me out, then hate me."  So he sat at
the edge of the cliff, perched like a fly on
a wall, until presently there came another
fly stealing up softly behind; a female
fly this, full as her little body could hold
of wanton mischief, to wit, the Burrows
girl, who clapped her dainty hands over
both La Mancha's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You must be Love," laughed the
Blackguard, "blinding a chap like that.
What nice soft fingers&mdash;Um!  Get away,
you minx, or I'll kiss you."
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!" said the minx, suddenly
releasing him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, sit down here, Impudence, and
tell me who taught you your manners."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't help it," she said in
justification.
</p>

<p>
"My Uncle is talking that poor boy
to death in the cabin.  Oh! so grave,
so solemn; I wanted to scream; I got
desperate!  So I came out."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Impudence."
</p>

<p>
Impudence sat down a yard off,
blushing hotly, her childlike face full of
reproach that she had been led astray
from last night's fine ideals.  So this was
the way she was playing the part of a
grown woman.  Pretty chance there was
if she behaved as it schoolgirl of being
Una with a growly Burrow!
</p>

<p>
"Miss Burrows," said the Blackguard,
"ain't you ashamed of yourself?  You've
interrupted the most serious thoughts,
you've rumpled my hair, you've put out
my pipe, you've damaged my complexion.
Nice sort of girl you are!"
</p>

<p>
She looked at his wicked bronzed
face&mdash;his complexion, indeed!  Then she
laughed, not knowing that every note of
her happiness went through the man like
an arrow.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, young lady, that I'm
dangerous, that I'm a bad lot, that your
mother, if you have one, would be afraid
to see you sitting near me, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be conceited about it,
anyway."
</p>

<p>
It was evidently no use trying to warn
her&mdash;she did not believe in evil, this sweet
maid, but trusted herself in his bad
company&mdash;ay, and trusted him.
</p>

<p>
Clever women had played with him&mdash;had
played with fire, but the wise ladies
had been badly burned.  Her defenceless
littleness was not like their strong towers.
They incited to attack, she to defence.
"Little woman," he said, "it's time for
me to be going."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but the sun's only just up, and
I must make amends for my Uncle's
manners.  I am going to make him
apologise to you&mdash;I am indeed.  He shall
go down on his bended knees.  You
must stay for dinner."
</p>

<p>
"But if I am not back in camp by
noon I shall be put under arrest, then
awful things will happen."
</p>

<p>
"What kind of things?"
</p>

<p>
"They'll clip my ears like a dog,
they'll chain me up, and give me bones
to gnaw.  It isn't as if I had a good
character.  A man with a good character
can get drunk whenever he likes, smash
things, punch people's heads, have a good
time; but me&mdash;I'm the Blackguard, so if
I look crossways at the Colonel's tent
it's mutiny."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!&mdash;how I'd like to see you
gnawing bones!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll kiss you unless you're civil."
</p>

<p>
"You daren't!"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"  The Blackguard sprang up
as she fled like the wind before him
along the edge of the cliff; but then she
turned, laughing over her shoulder&mdash;the
little flirt, at which he drew himself up,
saluting as though she were the Queen.
"I forgot," said the Blackguard regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"What?" asked the girl in fearless
innocence.
</p>

<p>
"Why, that my horse is whinnying
for me.  He just loves to be saddled up
and ridden all day.  Come, make friends
with the Devil while I saddle him."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
The Tenderfoot must see the Blackguard
a mile or so on his way, but La Mancha
took him by a new route which sloped
down quickly into the timber.  The
boy's heart beat high because the
Blackguard treated him now as an equal,
almost as a chum, and this, which he
would have disdained yesterday morning,
seemed a great condescension to-day.
In his heart of hearts Mr. Ramsay
felt a new thing&mdash;a craving for the rough
frontier life, for the romance of savagery.
A real Britisher is never thoroughly
civilised; inside the veneer of the university
lurks the schoolboy barbarian, blessed
with the hereditary instinct of clenched
fists, which gives world-mastery to the
Dominant Race, that blood-thirst of the
Vikings, that chivalry of the Middle
Ages, that headlong courage of the sea
heroes who took to water in the great
days of Elizabeth, that masterfulness
which afterwards created the most
glorious empire the world has ever seen.
Britain is not in Fleet Street, or Mayfair,
or the City, but at heart a rough race of
conquerors and rulers.  So this Tenderfoot
from Balham, awakening in one
short day, shook off the garments of
conventionalism, worshipping the Blackguard
because he was brave and strong,
hung furtively a pace behind him as they
walked, that he might gloat upon a pair of
big rowelled spurs, a glittering cartridge
belt, and a big sheathed revolver.  That
is the way of an English lad since the very
beginning, and that must be the way until
the time when we fall to rise no more.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't we ride?" he asked, for
the Blackguard was leading both horses,
tied head to tail.
</p>

<p>
"Because horses weren't built to carry a
weight down hill.  Their knees are weak."
</p>

<p>
Said the Tenderfoot fatuously, "But
you're a Spaniard, they say."
</p>

<p>
"And what of that?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought Spaniards were always
beastly cruel."
</p>

<p>
Yesterday the Blackguard would have
struck any man living for saying as
much.  Now he grinned.
</p>

<p>
"You're improving, Charlie.  You'll be
getting damaged presently for cheek.  If I
were all Spaniard I'd ride down here at a
gallop.  I'd ride over you to begin with,
just to see the blood squirting.  As it is, the
Spanish end of me isn't over safe to fool
with, though the English end of me rather
fancies your confounded impudence."
</p>

<p>
"So you're half English?"
</p>

<p>
"My mother was English."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
Presently the Blackguard asked a question,
watching narrowly what the effect
would be.  "I suppose, Charlie, you'll be
flirting with Miss Burrows up yonder?"
</p>

<p>
The lad blushed hotly.
</p>

<p>
"I thought so, Charlie.  Halt; look
me square in the eyes, if you can.  The
Spanish end of me wanted to ride you
down just now; it got jealous, but the
English end of me thinks it only common
decency to warn you.  I may be flirting
with that girl myself,&mdash;I suppose because
I oughtn't to think of her on a regular
month's fine of my pay and Government
rations.  You needn't look like a
frost-bitten chipmunk,&mdash;the betting is ten to
one on you, because you're a presentable
candidate, and I'm not, worse luck.  The
betting is a hundred to one on you, because
you've got the field all to yourself,
you brat.  Besides that, you're
good-looking in a way, with those infernally
frank blue eyes, while I look like the very
devil.  We've each got to take our chance,
and when she makes her choice, the devil
take the hindmost.  You understand?"
</p>

<p>
"But it's not that way at all."  Mr. Ramsay
was blushing.  "She's an
awfully nice girl&mdash;but&mdash;fact is," he drew
himself up, and added with slow
magnificence, "I'm not a marrying man."
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard laughed.  "Well,
let's drop that and get down to the
Tough Nut Claim before dinner-time.
By the way, when you meet these
prospectors, take care not to let them
suspect why you came to this country,
because, if they think you represent
money in London, they'll make it a point
of honour to sell you a wild-cat claim."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you bring me this way?"
</p>

<p>
"When that cad Burrows has talked
you blind you'll need a friend or so to
lead you about.  Come on, we'll have
dinner at the Claim."
</p>

<p>
Among the torchlike pines they came
to a little log-cabin, with a door and
window in front, shaded by an extension
of the ridge roof, and at the back a
chimney of sticks wattled over with clay.
Just beyond, a cutting had been made
into the hill, this being the entrance to a
tunnel, the waste rock from which had
been spread out into a terrace, or dump,
littered with heaps of silver-bearing lead,
all glittering in the sunlight.  From
within the tunnel came the steady clang
of a sledge-hammer beating a bar of steel
into live rock; but the Blackguard
tethered his horses to a stump, and the
two men sat down in a rough smithy.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" Mr. Ramsay sniffed
disdainfully.  "It looks like some
blacksmith's shop."
</p>

<p>
"It is," said La Mancha, lighting his
pipe.  "They use it for sharpening the
points of the drills.  Look here, youngster,
for fear of trouble when you meet
these prospectors, I'm going to give you
a dose of etiquette.
</p>

<p>
"If you meet a westerner, call him
'my good man.'
</p>

<p>
"When you dine with him, criticise
the food, ask how much there's to pay,
and look on while he washes up.
</p>

<p>
"Always make him keep his distance,
and, if he won't take the hint, talk about
your big relations&mdash;your friend, the
Duchess of Balham, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
"When you light your cigar, don't
offer him one first.
</p>

<p>
"Afterwards, when you meet, give him
your finger-tips to shake, or don't even
notice him.
</p>

<p>
"Always"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stop," cried the Tenderfoot, hot with
rage and shame.  "Do you think I'm
such an awful cad as that?"
</p>

<p>
"You were yesterday, my buck, when
you left camp.
</p>

<p>
"For instance, just now you set off to
walk this way with me because you were
too uneasy to say good-bye.  You thought
you ought to offer me a tip, but you
didn't dare."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose I had?" asked the other sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"I'd have thrashed you to a jelly.  I
always over-exert myself when I lose my
temper."
</p>

<p>
For a minute or so the Blackguard
watched a gaily-striped squirrel, a
"chipmunk," which was playing with
some nut-shells by the forge.  "Cheep,"
said La Mancha, with a queer click of
the tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Cheep," responded the animal, still busy.
</p>

<p>
"Cheep," said La Mancha again, whereupon
the dainty little beast sat on end,
with furry tail coiled Up its furry back,
and looked from one to the other to see
which spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Cheep," said La Mancha, at which
the chipmunk glanced derisively at the
Englishman's riding-breeches, then ran up
the big man's boot and perched on his knee.
</p>

<p>
"How's the nut business, eh, little man?"
</p>

<p>
"Cheep, cheep," clicked the chipmunk;
then, disdaining any further overtures
of friendship, scuttled off to play
again with his nut-shells.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ramsay sat in high dudgeon,
brooding over his wrongs, much to the
Blackguard's amusement as he smoked
peacefully until the prospectors should be
ready to knock off work at the dinner-hour.
The clang of the sledge-hammer
had ceased, a willowy man in long boots
and a muddy complexion crossed from
the tunnel to the cabin, the dinner smoke
began to float up from the chimney, from
within the tunnel came a sound of tapping,
then thumping, then silence.
</p>

<p>
"Tamping in the charges," muttered
La Mancha; "there'll be blasting soon.
Cheer up, Charlie; Long Leslie saw us
when he went to the cabin, or he wouldn't
have made a dinner fire on a hot day like
this."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ramsay disdained to answer, so La
Mancha smoked peacefully, watching the
chipmunk at play.
</p>

<p>
A second muddy man came running
from the tunnel, dodging behind the ore
bank, yelling "Look out!"  A volley of
stones came flying out after him; a dull
explosion shook the hillside.
</p>

<p>
"All right?" called the second muddy
man, now eagerly examining the fragments
just thrown out.  "I'll be with
you, Blackguard, in a jiffy."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ramsay had picked up a yellow
object from the bench beside him,
something which might have been a very big
stick of barley sugar, yet felt rather like
wax.
</p>

<p>
"Give that to me," said the Blackguard;
then, seeing that the other resented
his tone of command, he made a
rapid grab at the stick.
</p>

<p>
Indignant because of the treatment he
received at the hands of a man who had
unconsciously flattered him into a feeling
of equality and friendship, the Tenderfoot
swung the yellow stick over his head
with a rapid aim at the squirrel.
</p>

<p>
"Take care," said the Blackguard,&mdash;"that's
dynamite."
</p>

<p>
It was too late.  The stick had already
flown from the youngster's hand, was
swirling across the smithy.  Then a red
flower seemed to bud in the air, which
became a gigantic blossom growing&mdash;
filling all the world, scorching hot.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard opened one eye, then
the other, lazily observant of the two
prospectors, who were lifting away the
ruins of their smithy.
</p>

<p>
"How's that Tenderfoot?  Is he dead?"
</p>

<p>
Shorty answered, with a gulp in his
throat, "So, you're alive?  That's good."
</p>

<p>
"But the Tenderfoot?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we got him out all right."
</p>

<p>
Shorty was wrenching at a small beam
which lay across La Mancha's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"No bones broken; but he hasn't
woke up.  Here, that takes the weight
off you.  How do you feel?"
</p>

<p>
"Middling," said the Blackguard, closing
his eyes again.  "Are the horses all
right?"
</p>

<p>
"Only scared."
</p>

<p>
"Ride up, one of you; fetch the
Burrows girl with some tintacks and the
family gum-pot.  Right arm broken
above the elbow.  Just like my
confounded luck.  They'll fine me another
month's pay for&mdash;breaking&mdash;leave."  And
then he fainted.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard groaned as he woke
up.  "Beg pardon, didn't mean to," he
said; then opening his eyes, "Are you
the Burrows girl, or a Christmas-card
angel?"
</p>

<p>
Miss Violet's eyes were red as she bent
over him, holding a half-empty flask.
</p>

<p>
"If you're a woman," he said, "please
kiss me."
</p>

<p>
She did.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  You're a very nice girl.
Do you know how to do what you're told?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded, trying to smile, which was
difficult, because her lips would curl the
wrong way.  "Then," he said, "take
two sticks of wood, cover them all over
with cotton wool, bind it down even with
bandages, then strap them on either side
of my arm, while Shorty and Long Leslie
pull the bones out straight.  Understand?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully frightened," whispered
Miss Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Be frightened afterwards, not now.
I always come to grief whenever I try to
be good.  I promise I won't ever do it
again; but be quick, my dear, and while
you're making the splints get somebody
to pour cold water on the swelling."
</p>

<p>
"How's that silly ass?" he asked
tenderly, while the work went forward;
and it was the Tenderfoot who answered
tearfully, "The silly ass is ashamed."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to inform you that
Mr. Ramsay has been delivered in good condition at
the Throne Mine.  I regret to add that he has
broken my left arm with a stick of dynamite
which he threw at a chipmunk, now deceased.
I will report to-morrow.
</p>

<p class="intro">
  "I have the honour to be, Sir,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your obedient servant,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOSÉ LAS MORẼNAN DE LA MANCHA,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constable.<br>
</p>

<p class="intro">
  "The Officer Commanding,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild Horse Creek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kootenay, B.C."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This letter, written with pain and
difficulty on a piece of wrapping paper, was
put, by the Blackguard's directions, into
one of the saddle-bags of Mr. Ramsay's
horse.
</p>

<p>
"Make her head fast by a check-rein
to the horn of the saddle," he said.
"Bash the animal on the hindquarters,
then turn her loose on the down trail
Since she can't feed until the check-rein's
unfastened, she'll go straight to camp,
unless she's a born fool."
</p>

<p>
He was sitting in front of the log-cabin,
his arm in splints and a sling, while the
prospectors.  Long Leslie and Shorty,
followed these instructions as to the horse.
When the mare was gone, to the extreme
disgust of La Mancha's huge black
charger, he looked from one to the other of
the two miners.
</p>

<p>
"Prospectors' luck," he said regretfully.
"Your chipmunk, now demised,
had a nibble of flour a day, while I eat by
the bushel."
</p>

<p>
"I guess we can stand it," said Shorty;
"you needn't growl till you're told."
</p>

<p>
"Prospectors' luck," said Long Leslie
wistfully, "brings a jolly good fellow to
remind us we're still alive.  It's your
turn, Shorty, to wash up&mdash;I'm going to
smoke."  So he sat down beside the
Blackguard, not the less enjoying his
after-supper pipe because his partner
must do the dirty work of the day.
"We've been getting lonesome these
last few months," he said,&mdash;"since the
Lunatic came."
</p>

<p>
"He's a cad!" said the Blackguard.
</p>

<p>
"It's not so much that, although a
Chinaman would be better company.
Shorty doesn't mind, he's used to it; but
I get thinking, and thinking.  What does
it all amount to&mdash;this life?"
</p>

<p>
"It's jolly good fun while it lasts."
</p>

<p>
"For you&mdash;yes.  I used to say the
same in my college days, but now&mdash;  Do
you know, Miss Burrows talked with me
to-day for the first time.  Before that
her greetings were like mine to a horse
when I stroke its nose.  I'm not thirty
yet, but from her point of view I don't
count."
</p>

<p>
"I think," said the Blackguard, "that
the symptoms demand a pill.  How is
our tongue?&mdash;our pulse?  Um!&mdash;ah!&mdash;we
shall get over it.  But seriously, why
don't you scratch up a fight with
somebody&mdash;say, with Shorty?  That would
do you a world of good."
</p>

<p>
"You're a rare good sort, Blackguard,
but you don't seem to understand.  This
Tough Nut Claim is as good as claims
go&mdash;nine feet of passable wet ores running
a steady average of thirty-five dollars
a ton; but until we get shipping facilities
it might as well be at the North Pole.
There'll be a railroad through the valley
in, say, ten years.  Suppose we sell out
then at fifty thousand&mdash;I shall be forty
then, and the only reading matter
meanwhile is the <i>New York Police Gazette</i>,
with a number of the <i>Century</i> perhaps
once in six months.  It isn't good
enough."
</p>

<p>
"By George, when a prospector gets
the blues he's worse than an old soldier.
Go on, if it does you good."
</p>

<p>
"I should have been all right but for
Burrows yonder, with plenty of cariboo,
not a few grizzlies; and these summits
would knock the spots out of the Alpine
Club.  But the Lunatic, as we call him,
has put us all out of date.  It's all very
well sneering at new ideas, but his
methods are further above our heads than
American quartz-mining is above the
fuddling of the old Spanish colonists.
They had ladder shafts, buckets for
pumping, an arastra for milling; we have
common sense tunnelling, and send
sorted ores to the smelter.  Burrows
sneers at our fissure veins, and quarries
the bare country granite.  Of course, I
knew all along that whole mountain
ranges run a dollar and a half to the ton,
but I didn't care while milling cost two
dollars a ton.  This man is a heaven-born
genius, who can mine, mill, and render
his gold into ingots for only a dollar a ton."
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard whistled.  "If that's
true," he said, "the man's got a corner
on gold&mdash;why, it's awful!"
</p>

<p>
"Archimedes said that he could capsize
the planet if he had leverage.  This man
has leverage; capitalise his idea, get the
place in the Sierras where there are the
best conditions of labour, power, freighting,
gradients, and a seaport; then turn
him loose because he has the philosopher's
stone which can transmute whole ranges
of mountains into gold."
</p>

<p>
"He's such a cad, too," said the Blackguard.
"But how did you find him out?"
</p>

<p>
"Worked in his mill last winter until
he sacked me for calling him a maniac.
I did that to draw him out, and once he
started bragging in self-defence I had
the key to his machinery.  He has two
rotary fans which get up a small cyclone
between them.  Into that cyclone he
throws scraps of rock, and the dust of
sharp-edged granite crystals cuts the
stones to powder before they have time
to drop.  He put in a crowbar once, and
I actually saw that inch-thick steel
shattered into dust."
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me," said the Blackguard,
"that my Tenderfoot is in for something
good."
</p>

<p>
"So I suspected, but would capitalists
send out a young fool like that?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know.  He's full of ignorance
and bliss, but he learns quickly,
doesn't get scared, keeps his mouth shut.
Besides, he's honest."
</p>

<p>
Something made La Mancha look
round, and there in the twilight, coming
down out of the woods, were Miss Burrows
and Mr. Ramsay, hand-in-hand.
</p>

<p>
The infantile innocence of their faces
made him laugh: the willowy prospector,
rather than embarrass any approaching
fun, dodged into the shanty; so, when
the enraptured couple stood before him,
the Blackguard sat alone.
</p>

<p>
"We thought we ought to tell you
first," the Tenderfoot simpered, blushing
hotly all over,&mdash;"we are engaged."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said the Blackguard gravely,
"since when?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, ever so long ago," Miss Burrows
sighed, "this afternoon.  Won't
you congratulate us?"
</p>

<p>
"Next week," said the Blackguard,
"if you are still of the same mind, you
shall receive my blessing.  Have you
told Mr. Burrows?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he was too busy&mdash;but we thought
that you would"&mdash;  Then the girl's face
flushed with a sudden indignation.  "You
said he would, Charlie, but he doesn't&mdash;he's
a beast!"
</p>

<p>
"I know," said the Blackguard; "that
is the nature of the animal.  Do you
think, my dear, that this young man is
worthy of you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," pondered the little
flirt, coyly enough; but, perhaps to prove
his ardour, dropped Mr. Ramsay's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, my dear,"&mdash;the Blackguard
was quite paternal,&mdash;"you are going
to be very beautiful?  How can I commend
this young gentleman's suit while I
love you myself?  I am jealous of my
young rival."  This because the rival was
very justly indignant.  "He is young, he
is very good-looking, and quite, oh, quite
respectable.  Now, I'm neither young,
nor good, nor beautiful, and I'm not a
bit respectable, so I can speak without
damaging his prospects.  I have no
chance whatever, but"&mdash;he bowed gracefully&mdash;"I
love you, my dear, very much."
</p>

<p>
The girl raised one eye to look at him,
then lowered both out of shyness, then
pouted towards Mr. Ramsay with her
forefinger pressed to her lips as though
considering; then, seeing that her fiancé
stood stupefied, she thought that she
owed him a lesson, and ran for the woods.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ramsay would have given chase at once.
</p>

<p>
"One moment," said the Blackguard,
smiling in his saturnine way, while a
twinge of pain from his arm made him
draw up stiffly.  "Young man, you don't
let the grass grow underfoot; you needn't
be in such a hurry&mdash;she'll wait for you,
and you have weeks and months to make
up for this minute.  About that shanty
you knocked down this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Well?  It's no business of yours&mdash;I
mean, forgive me for talking like that."
</p>

<p>
"I forgive you," said the Blackguard
blandly.  "Don't you think you owe
these gentlemen some apology&mdash;some
compensation?"
</p>

<p>
"But I daren't offer money."
</p>

<p>
"You've too much sense.  Look here.
Burrows keeps a sort of store to supply
the prospectors hereabouts.  I daresay
he'd sell you a couple of Winchester rifles,
with a case or so of ammunition, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks&mdash;what a relief!  And
they won't be angry?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very.  Now, young man, keep
your eye on Miss Violet, because, if I can,
I mean to cut you out.  I've not much
chance, but it's fair to give you warning.
Now you may run away."

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
On the following evening the Blackguard,
white with pain, rode on his
great black charger into camp, reported
huskily to the Orderly Sergeant, and
straightway fell out of the saddle, having
fainted.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel was deeply touched when
he heard of this.  "Indeed," he said to
the Sergeant-Major, "that ride down
from the Throne is one of the pluckiest
things I ever heard of.  How many men
have I who would not make a broken
arm excuse for a month of bilking?"
</p>

<p>
"He's the best man in D Division,
sir, with all his crazy whims."
</p>

<p>
"When he's fit for light duty," said
the Colonel, "find La Mancha an easy
billet with staff pay.  I'd make him a
corporal if he'd only keep straight.  Tell
him I say so."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel was a very fine gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"You can tell him from me," said the
Blackguard roughly, "that his butter's
been standing too long in the sun to
suit my teeth.  He can go to blazes and
have the devil for corporal."
</p>

<p>
But the Sergeant-Major only smiled
under his grey moustache, knowing that
this from the Blackguard meant gratitude;
so, with consent of the Hospital
Sergeant, La Mancha was given charge
of all the horses, with sevenpence-half-penny
extra per day for nominal services.
</p>

<p>
Half the troop was out on patrol, or
detachment, as usual; discipline at
headquarters had relaxed for the summer, and
the men left in camp found leisure during
the long hot days for no end of lazy
swimming down in the river.  The
Mooyie patrol would come clattering in
at sundown; the Windermere patrol
would ride out in the cool forenoon; the
Weekly Mail arrived and departed on
Wednesday; small detachments turned
up now and again with Indians, or white
desperadoes carefully shackled.  So all
the men waxed brown, fat, and
disorderly, having more good meat than
they could swallow, fishing, shooting,
and occasionally some stirring bout with
a horse-thief or murderer at bay.  Golden
days, starlit nights in the open, a rousing
gallop down the meadows, a bath in the
river, a cool pipe by the camp fire, with
a paradise to live in, the brotherhood of
the West for a human interest: such was
the life of D Troop all that glorious
summer.  Officers and men had fought
shoulder-to-shoulder through the red-hot
excitement of the war only two years
ago; they had buried their dead, avenged
them with slaughter&mdash;and that was a
bond of blood between them still.
</p>

<p>
Long years have passed since 1887,
the living are scattered now across the
world, but when two old comrades meet,
perchance to fight side-by-side again in
Rhodesia, or one to help the other out
of trouble on some beach in the Southern
Seas, or to dine together at a white
table in the parish of St. James', dressed
up like ridiculous waiters, the bond of
blood is strong between us still.  The
news told then of the old troop begets
no laughter: A. deserted; B. shot
himself; C. died of typhoid; D., of bad
liquor; E. has disappeared; F. is
supposed to have fallen at the Yalu; G. was
found frozen to death in a coal-shed at
Medicine Hat; but for the rest, spirits
are calling across the deep from all the
continents and all the oceans, and the
glass that was lifted for the toast of the
good old times falls shattered because
some strange remembered voice comes
from among the candles, "Well, here's luck!"
</p>

<p>
But although everything at Wild
Horse Creek remained pretty much as
before, the Blackguard was entirely
changed since his trip to the Throne.
Mother Darkness was alleged to be
meditating an action for breach of promise;
word went by the patrols up to Golden,
down to the United States boundary, that
La Mancha was "on the make."  Corporal
Dandy Irvine, on detachment at
Windermere, sent down a box of cigars for
thankoffering.  The Colonel, in private
correspondence with a friend at Fort
Saskatchewan, sent the news as of more
interest than even his record of trout.
So the tale spread among the Mounted
Police, from the Saskatchewan to the
boundary, from the foothills to Manitoba,
over five hundred thousand square miles
of the Great Plains, that the Blackguard
had "got religion."
</p>

<p>
The announcement was made by La
Mancha himself down at the bathing-place.
"Yes, boys, I've got religion;
I've sworn off getting drunk, I'm far
too good to live.  If any son of a gun
corrupts my morals by saying cuss words
in my presence, I'll tear off his hide
from scalp to heels, and roll him in salt
for a"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why, dammit!" said Mutiny, spluttering
up after a dive.
</p>

<p>
"Mutiny," answered the Blackguard,
"the word 'dammit' is profane language.
Come out and have your eyes bunged up,
you"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"See you in &mdash;&mdash; first!" said Mutiny
blandly, upon which the Blackguard,
half-dressed after his bath, forgetting
that his left arm was broken, walked
into the river, gave chase, captured his
prey, grabbed him by his red hair, and
ducked him until he nearly choked,
making remarks the while which are
quite impossible to repeat.
</p>

<p>
"How can I be meek and gentle,"
he said afterwards, "when you fellows
disturb my peace of mind by using vulgar
language?  Any man who doesn't want
to behave like a Methodist minister
at a tea-party has got to fight me
first."
</p>

<p>
Two or three tried, but as La Mancha
with one hand was equal to any able-bodied
pugilist in D Troop, there set in
a tyranny more ruthless than that of the
Commissioner at headquarters during
the setting-up drills.  Only the
Blackguard and the Sergeant-Major could
relieve their feelings, except under pain of
dire chastisement, and before pay-day
any man who wanted to tell an improper
story found it expedient to resort to the
canteen.
</p>

<p>
Now, it so happened that a regulation
English Curate missionising in the
neighbourhood, being grieved at the spiritual
destitution of the Mounted Police, had
offered to hold an open-air service monthly
at Wild Horse Creek.  So the Colonel,
to encourage the young man, ordered a
church-parade.  One or two, including
La Mancha, got out of it by being for the
time Roman Catholic, others found it
impossible to neglect staff duties such as
cooking, the rest had their names put
on the sick-list.  The Colonel thereupon
commanded that sick and cripples, cooks
and Catholics, should, at the sound of
the bugle, attend his parade on pain of
being cast into prison.
</p>

<p>
This brought about a mass-meeting,
at which it was proposed by the Blackguard,
and seconded by all hands, that
any son of a sea-cook who sang,
responded, contributed, or otherwise
assisted during the church-parade
should afterwards be chastised with
belts.
</p>

<p>
The service was a duet between the
Parson and the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards the regulation Curate,
mounted in deep dejection upon a mule,
was riding away to an afternoon service
elsewhere when he was waylaid in a
lonely place by the Blackguard.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Padre."
</p>

<p>
The Curate, responding to a military
salute, drew rein.  "Can I be of service
to you?"
</p>

<p>
"If you can spare me a moment."
</p>

<p>
The Curate dismounted, and, letting
his mule graze at the end of the rein,
sat down by La Mancha's side.  "I have
heard, Mr. La Mancha, that you are a
Roman Catholic."
</p>

<p>
"So have I.  Now at the canteen we
ask for Scotch, but we only get hell
smoke.  It isn't good, but it gets there
all the same.  I want to sample your
religion."
</p>

<p>
"It was freely offered to you this
morning, though."
</p>

<p>
"No, it was rammed down our throats,
so I didn't quite catch the flavour."
</p>

<p>
"You mean, the parade was compulsory."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; if it had been left to our choice
the only men absent would have been the
cook and the herder, but your performance
this morning disagreed with
us.  We called it an insult to
Pater-Noster, and any man who took part in
that would have been thrashed within an
inch of his life."
</p>

<p>
"I think you were right," said the
Curate.  "Believe me, Mr. La Mancha, I
shall never, so long as I live, forget this
lesson.  The next service shall be free."
</p>

<p>
"Then we shall read you the second
lesson, Padre."
</p>

<p>
"Which is?"
</p>

<p>
"That we haven't had a chance of
going to church for months.  Hand
round the hat and I promise you there
won't be any buttons.  Another thing,
cover your reading-desk with the Union
Jack and there'll be no whispering."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because a year after the Rebellion,
when we had memorial church-parades
for the dead, the order was, 'Side arms
and the flag on the table.'  The boys
will remember."
</p>

<p>
"This is wonderful!  And now, my
dear fellow, since you've helped me so
much, how can I help you?"
</p>

<p>
La Mancha looked across the valley,
then slowly raised his eyes up to the
Throne Mine; but what he said or what
the Curate answered belongs to
themselves and to the Almighty.
</p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p>
One of the Blackguard's endearing traits
had always been his generosity&mdash;boundless
in that when he had nothing of his
own to give he lent and gave things that
were not his own, causing thereby much
internecine strife.  The only time he had
ever been known to be worsted in fair
fight was after lending to an intending
deserter the shot-gun which he had
borrowed from Buckeye Blossom, heavy-weight
champion of Medicine Hat.  But
now he had got religion, and had fought
two pitched battles for the right to read
his Bible.  Not that the boys cared much
what was his choice of literature, it being
all the same to the crowd whether he
amused himself with the Bible, or a
dictionary, or the <i>New York Police
Gazette</i>, provided that he kept it to
himself; but the Blackguard, for want of
practice in the art, found it convenient to
read like a schoolboy, aloud.  Hence the
pitched battles, which resulted in undisturbed
readings from the Gospels, mingled
with a running commentary, so naive, so
quaint, and so exceedingly funny, that the
audience waxed daily in numbers, until,
for peace and quiet, the reader betook
himself to the shelter of the woods.  Here
he read daily, expounding the Scriptures
to an audience of disdainful squirrels and
song-birds.
</p>

<p>
But to return to the matter of his
generosity.
</p>

<p>
The immediate outcome of his queer
religion was that the Blackguard became
more avaricious than Shylock.  When
his chum, Dandy Irvine, sent him that
box of cigars from Windermere, instead
of giving them all away to his friends,
he sold them two for a shilling.  Some
brought cash, with which, and a little
credit, he bought a further supply; but
for the most part the boys accepted the
trading as a joke, running up accounts
which they imagined to be purely fictitious.
Then pay-day came, when the Blackguard
was able for the first time to partially
release his left arm, when, also for the
first time, he had staff-pay not hypothecated
by any previous fine.  After the
parade he went to all his debtors.
</p>

<p>
"Little Murphy, you owe me one dollar
for cigars."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come off," said little Murphy
innocently.  "What game do you think
you're playing at?"
</p>

<p>
"Pay or fight," said the Blackguard.
</p>

<p>
Murphy paid, also all the others, big
and little, when the Blackguard went
about smiling grimly upon his customers.
But if he was ruthless in exacting cash
or black eyes, La Mancha was punctilious
as to the payment of his own debts&mdash;in
cigars.  He became wholesale dealer to
the sergeants' mess and the canteen,
imported pipes, dealt in shot-guns,
ornamental revolvers, books, and musical
instruments.  His mouth organs, tin
whistles, and concertinas became a far
worse nuisance in the valley than ever
the Indians had been, but even these had
comparatively little to say compared with
La Mancha's pigs.  Possibly the story of
Daniel led to the cornet, concertina, Jews'
harp, mouth organ, penny whistle, oboe,
and all kinds of music; by La Mancha's
own confession, the matter of the
Gadarene swine suggested a litter of pigs,
bought cheap from a rancher, raised on
the cook's hitherto misapplied slops, and
ultimately sold at a handsome profit to
the Quartermaster.  All this was a
matter of time, but under enormous
disadvantages, despite the delay and
inconvenience caused by almost incessant
travelling on duty, the Blackguard was
reputed long before autumn to be the
richest man in D Troop.
</p>

<p>
But to return to a much earlier date.
When the Tenderfoot's luggage was
brought over from Windermere, Dandy
Irvine, who was then at headquarters,
volunteered its safe delivery at the Throne
Mine in consideration of leave for hunting
between Saturday and Monday.  It was
then that the Blackguard wrote his first
letter to Miss Violet Burrows.
Letter-writing in camp is always a serious
matter, because the needful materials
must be borrowed or improvised.  When
a recruit first joins, he is apt to write
mainly to frighten his mother with the
assumption of mythical surroundings
borrowed from inexpensive fiction, thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"DEAR MOTHER,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
"I write in the saddle, on the summit
of the Rocky Mountains, surrounded by hostile
Indians, a sword in one hand and a revolver in
the other."  [Then the young imagination flags.]
"There is no news, but please write soon,&mdash;and
send some money, as washing is awfully expensive.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"YOUR LOVING SON."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But a hardened sinner like the Blackguard
writes seldom or never, finding the
pen awkward after shovel, axe, and gun;
so the epistle to Miss Burrows, of course
a strictly private communication, was
delivered painfully, tongue in cheek, head
askew, with a perhaps too copious
discharge of ink.
</p>

<p>
Miss Violet read it with such a disdainful
tilt of her little pert nose that the
blotted characters were well-nigh out of
range.  She was sitting during the
Sunday rest at the cliff edge, with Dandy
Irvine on one side and Mr. Ramsay,
jealously observant, on the other.  "Humph,"
she looked sideways at the glowing scarlet
of Dandy's serge jacket, then at his
shining boots and glittering spurs, "he came
up here," she said, "in an undershirt
and one of those flappy hats.  Besides,
he was all dusty."
</p>

<p>
"But then, you see," explained the
Blackguard's champion, "he can afford
to please himself as to appearances.  If I
were a great aristocrat I might do the
same."
</p>

<p>
"A great what?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know?  His brother is a
Duke, Ambassador from Spain to the
Court of St. James'; La Mancha's cousins
are mostly emperors, kings, and grand
dukes; the Cid was one of his ancestors,
not to mention Charles the Fifth and
Philip the Second.  Of course, he's only a
Don, which means 'My lord,' but"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There," cried Miss Violet.  "Oh,
won't I give my Uncle beans&mdash;I'll teach him!"
</p>

<p>
"You must not neglect your filial
duties, Miss Burrows; you must bring
him up in the way he should go; it's your
duty."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me some more."
</p>

<p>
"I will.  Who let him leave the
mountain before his arm was properly set?
When he got back to camp he just
managed to report to the Orderly Sergeant,
then rolled off his horse in a dead
swoon.  You ought to have kept him
here for a month."
</p>

<p>
Miss Burrows turned upon the Tenderfoot
in withering scorn.  "Your fault
entirely!"
</p>

<p>
After that the Tenderfoot sulked.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me some more," said the lady.
</p>

<p>
"Well, two years ago, when we had
our first scrapping match with the
half-breeds, we got an awful thrashing.
You've heard of Duck Lake Fight?"
</p>

<p>
"Sit up and listen."  Miss Violet
brought the Tenderfoot to attention with
a very small pebble, which missed.  "Oh,
this is awfully jolly,&mdash;do go on!"
</p>

<p>
"There were ninety-four of us, police
and civilians, caught in a trap by three
hundred and sixty rebels.  They were all
round us under cover in a sort of horseshoe
position, with a detachment stealing
quietly through the bush to cut off our
rear.  We police unharnessed, drew up
the sleighs in line by way of shelter, with
one seven-pounder on the right, all in a
mortal funk.  Joe McKay, our half-breed
interpreter, rode forward with Crozier to
meet an Indian who came out with a
white rag to talk.  We thought they
would argue all day, but suddenly the
Indian made a grab at McKay's rifle;
and Joe drew his revolver and riddled
him.  Then Crozier gave the order to
fire, but Joe Howe, in charge of the gun,
yelled out, 'You're right in our way, sir!'
</p>

<p>
"'Never mind me!' said Crozier.
Then the rifles began to crackle on both
sides, and our thirty-five civilians were
detached off up a lane on the right.  One
of the police boys was sent to recall them,
because the snow was waist-deep when
once they got off the trail.  The way was
a sort of lane, with a fence on the left,
bush on the right shutting off all view of
the main crowd, and a log-house at the
end full of loop-holes pouring out a most
awful fire.  You see, the half-breeds had
filled that little house with all their crack
marksmen, while our boys had nothing to
aim at but logs and smoke.  Men were
falling thick, the snow was too deep for
a charge, and there was no particular use
for getting to that house anyway.  At
last, what was left of the party fell back,
fighting hard, leaving their dead in the
snow.  But one of them wasn't dead,
only wounded, and that was the policeman
who had followed the civilians out
of shelter.  He saw the half-breeds
swarming down from the cabin, Indians
swinging their clubbed rifles to make
sure of those who were down by cracking
skulls.  I guess that policeman was too
far gone to care; he watched them lazily
through a sort of haze, forgetting all
about the full revolver slung on his belt.
Of course, there were no white men left in
sight, but Indians and half-breeds were
swarming out from cover as our whole
outfit, police and civilian, harnessed their
teams for the retreat.  But one of the
police remembered having seen his own
chum go out after the fools' charge of
civilians, and never come back.  Any
other man would have tried his best to
forget, but this chap broke away through
the bush, waded in deep snow to where
his chum lay among the dead, fired a few
revolver shots to keep back the Indians,
slung the wounded man over his shoulder,
and brought him back to the main road
just as the last sleigh was passing under
cover of the rear-guard."
</p>

<p>
"What a hero!" cried the Tenderfoot.
"Yes; that was the Blackguard, and
the wounded man was <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Charlie," said Miss Violet after that
interview, "why are you only a Tenderfoot?"
</p>

<p>
"You're always flinging that in my
face.  How can I help it?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be cross.  A Romeo by any
other name would&mdash;.  No, a quotation
is worse than a rat-trap.  But there is
something wrong with you; I know
there is.  You don't wear pretty clothes
like Mr. Irvine, you don't write me beautiful
blotty love-letters like the Blackguard."
</p>

<p>
"How can"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Now, there you are again, flying at
me like a sitting hen when I poke too
hard.  I took you to worship me on
approval&mdash;you don't suit&mdash;you're too
horrid; I shall give you a month's
notice&mdash;so there!  Now, as to giving you a
'character.'  Of course, I don't want to
be hard&mdash;so you be very good this month
and&mdash;I'll see about it."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Burrows was gravely disturbed.
Sufficient had been his responsibility ever
since a dying sister bequeathed to him the
guardianship of her child.  At first he had
not taken the matter very seriously.  The
girl was at school, doubtless being well
cared for, but presently, although every
dollar he could raise was needed for
costly mining machinery, he had to pay
her tuition fees.  Then the Lady
Superintendent wrote, hinting deftly that her
pupil had reached an age when the
chaperon might have a more desirable
influence than a teacher.  He never read
between the lines, he was too little a man
of the world to realise that a paying
pupil would not be unacceptable to any
lady superintendent so long as the young
person was docile.  The young person in
question was anything but docile, as
Mr. Burrows found to his grief when Miss
Violet came to rule himself and his mine
with a rod of iron.  Certainly she cost
less at a time of straitened means than
his late Chinese cook; but then, she was
such a nuisance.  He loved her not at all,
his affections being wholly devoted to
certain patented steel fans in a cylinder.
Unlike the steel fans, she set his will at
naught, ignored his rules, his regulations,
his beautifully machine-made precepts,
distracted him with interruptions, pulled
his ear, demanded new frocks which were
quite beyond his means, and finally, to
crown her misdemeanours, fell in love.
His cylinder never fell in love, or, if it
conceived so indelicate a line of action, would
certainly refrain from two several and
concurrent flirtations.
</p>

<p>
Miss Violet seemed bound by no rules,
subject to no conceivable laws, therefore,
like that nonsensical abstraction, Religion,
she was beyond the pale of reasonable
study.  Not being acquainted with the
factors of the love problem, or dealing in
the abstruse mathematics of whims,
Mr. Burrows blandly ignored the whole subject
for six weeks; consequently, when circumstances
compelled him to bring to bear the
forces of his intellect, he was just six weeks
too late.  So far as he could see, which was
not quite to the end of his nose, he then
found the facts somewhat as follows.
</p>

<p>
Miss Violet was in love, but whether
with young Ramsay, or with that big
policeman, or with both at once, was a
matter of no moment.  Inasmuch as
Mr. Burrows had reached the age of fifty
without loving anybody better than
himself, Miss Violet's behaviour was at once
ridiculous and unnatural.  She was only
nineteen, a child fresh from school, her
vocation in life to cook his meals, make
his bed, keep her tongue from chatter and
her fingers from his ears.  (The fact that
his ears were large and seductively ugly
could not palliate the young woman's
mania for stroking them.)  In short, Miss
Violet had no right to love, and, as to
marrying, her duty was to himself.
Almost with tears in his eyes he pictured the
loneliness to which she would selfishly
consign him if she married.  She should
not marry&mdash;it would not be good for her.
</p>

<p>
Then there was the big policeman, who
never failed to spend his Sundays hard by
at the Tough Nut Claim.  Mr. Burrows,
priding himself on his powers of observation,
found something furtive, something
underhand and dishonourable in the way
that policeman avoided his own hospitality.
He had written to the Officer Commanding
at Wild Horse Creek, protesting on behalf
of the "mining population" against
weekly visits of a disreputable character to
the Throne Mining Camp.  This took effect
upon the Colonel, who counted any
disparagement of his men as a personal affront
to himself, and, pending the chastisement
of the writer, saw that La Mancha never
asked in vain for Sunday's leave.
</p>

<p>
And, last element of the love problem,
Mr. Ramsay, who should have been making
an exhaustive study of mine and mill for
his father's firm, spent the time sulking
about the hills.  A workhouse pauper
who has dropped a penny down a grating
could not have looked more forlorn.
</p>

<p>
So two months went by.  Miss Violet
very demure, like a kitten after its first
mouse; the Blackguard spending every
Saturday and Sunday night in the saddle
to snatch brief hours for courtship; the
Tenderfoot perched in desolate places
brooding on suicide.
</p>

<p>
Then of a sudden Mr. Ramsay became
demurely expectant, and Miss Violet
unnaturally gay.  Some new absurdity was
in the wind, so Mr. Burrows, with the
gingerly air of one broaching a gift of
untasted wine, had a few words with his
niece.
</p>

<p>
"Come here, Violet."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Uncle."
</p>

<p>
"What does all this mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, Uncle."
</p>

<p>
"That policeman did not come to the
Tough Nut Claim on Sunday."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't he, Uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't he come?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know.  He doesn't
belong to me.  Do you want him very
much, Uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"Want him?  Of course, I don't want
him.  What should I want him for?
Now, answer me this&mdash;what are your
intentions with regard to Mr. Ramsay?"
</p>

<p>
"I was just thinking about that."  She
perched on the table beside him.  "The
saucepan's too small, you see.  Would
you like him poached?"
</p>

<p>
Since there was but little change to be
got out of Miss Violet, Mr. Burrows
went off fuming and fussing in search
of his guest, who was discovered in
a state of innocent bliss, fishing with
rod and line from the edge of the great
precipice.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, you'll disturb the swallows.
One of them pecked my worm."
</p>

<p>
"Haw&mdash;ah&mdash;indeed."  Mr. Burrows
sat down on the next rock, grunting.
"Mister Ramsay, I know that these
matters are delicate, and require to be
dealt with by a man of tact."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed they do&mdash;they won't even look
at a fly."
</p>

<p>
"I am not alluding to birds, Mr. Ramsay.
May I ask what your intentions
are with regard to my niece?"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"  Mr. Ramsay glanced at the
other sideways.  "I say, would you mind
very much if I were to&mdash;to pay my
addresses to Miss Violet?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, my dear Mr. Ramsay.
The human affection always meets with
my warmest approbation&mdash;the&mdash;in fact,
my very warmest approbation.  Let me
shake you by the hand."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't, if I were you&mdash;fact
is&mdash;worms, you know.  I hope you're not
sitting on any of them?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Burrows' approbation of the human
affections was suddenly mitigated; he
jumped up with a sudden but strictly
philosophical remark&mdash;but seeing that
this matter of the worms was a false
alarm, he breathed more freely, and,
grunting again, sat down.
</p>

<p>
"No, that's all right!" the Tenderfoot
felt very much relieved.  "You haven't
spoilt one of them.  I ought to tell you,
though,&mdash;you were so busy I didn't like to
mention it before,&mdash;that we're engaged."
</p>

<p>
"Since when, my dear young friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, months ago&mdash;it must be supper
time.  Why don't they bite?  I love her
desperately."
</p>

<p>
"Your sentiments do you justice.  The
alliance between our families will do
much, my young friend, to strengthen the
material bonds which are about to so
closely unite my interests to those of your
respected father.  The brilliant future in
store for the Burrows-Ramsay Mining
&amp; Milling Syndicate Limited"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"By George," cried the Tenderfoot
joyfully, while the rod jerked in his hand,
"I've got a bite!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<p>
Down by the American boundary a
stream called Eagle Creek has cut
a ravine two hundred feet deep in the
plateau at the base of the Rockies,
carving the banks into a medley of
grotesque and isolated mounds strewn
with boulders, nearly void of grass,
whose eccentric shapes give the view
from the bottom a most singular and
impressive contour.  The stream itself
had dwindled under the autumn heat,
leaving only a string of miry ponds,
whose stagnant waters fed the few
fruit-laden shrubs upon their margins, and
beside them was half an acre left of pleasant
grass.  Here were round patches, traces
of camp-fires, by which many travellers in
that lonely way had been wont to rest.
How waggons got down the trail to the
bottom without accident is one of the
many wonders of the West.
</p>

<p>
The sun was set behind the Selkirks,
the wind was sinking, the air had a blue
dryness blown from some forest fire;
heavy, sultry enough to make all nature
sulk.  Foxes were dodging about from
cover to cover, a crane stood melancholy
in the untroubled water, meditating on
one leg, hopeless of even a desultory
minnow by way of supper.  A cloud of
dust arose behind the southern boundary
of the ravine, the crane flapped
sorrowfully away, hearing a distant tramp of
horses, and presently a mounted man in
bright cavalry uniform rode to the edge
of the hills, standing out against the
deepening sky a beautiful silhouette,
motionless as a statue.  Then, two by
two, came twenty mounted men, each
with a rifle poised on the horn of his
Mexican saddle, and many a glittering
point of brass and steel about his harness.
At a word of command they dismounted
to advance, leading their horses down the
slope; while behind them appeared five
waggons, each carrying two men, and
a rear-guard of two, who lingered a bit
to be clear of the dust which arose in
clouds from the groaning wheels of the
transport.  Some of these riders wore
canvas clothes adorned with brass buttons,
some buckskin suits, or blue flannel shirts,
or old red jackets, according to the pleasure
of the wearers.  All had riding-boots,
spurs, leather belts carrying a row of brass
cartridges, and big revolvers with a
lanyard buckled to the butts, and passing
over one shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the level land at the bottom,
the mounted men formed up in line, and
the waggons drew up behind them, forty
feet apart; a rope was stretched along
the waggon line, then, leaving his saddle
at the dismounting point, each trooper
had made his horse fast to the rope before
ever the teams were unharnessed.  Meanwhile
three men from the transport had
selected a spot by some bushes where an
iron bar was set on uprights five feet
apart; and, before the sound of axes had
ceased in the bush behind, three full camp
kettles swung over a roaring fire.  A bell
tent was pitched for the officer in command,
Inspector Fraser Gaye; the horses were
watered, groomed, fed with a liberal ration
of oats; then, at a last merry call from
the bugle, there was a general dash to the
waggons for plates and cups, and knives
were whipped from belt or bootleg, ready
for an astonishing slaughter of fried pork
and hard tack, mitigated with lashings of
scalding tea.  The meal was followed by
an uplifting of delicate grey smoke toward
the clouds, and a lively fire of chaff in
most of the British and American dialects.
</p>

<p>
At times the whole crowd would turn
upon one or two who dared to converse in
their native French-Canadian patois, "A
wuss Nitchie!  Can't you talk white?
Get away back to your reserve, or behave
like a white man, you mongrel!"
</p>

<p>
But all this was silenced presently,
because the horses must be hobbled, or
picketed out for the night, and a guard
of three men was detailed to watch by
turns until sunrise.  Blankets were being
spread out along the saddle line, and in
and under the waggons; first post
sounded, last post sounded, then the
third of the bugle melodies.
</p>

<p>
"That's all, boys.  Dream of the girls
you've lost.  Lights&mdash;out!"
</p>

<p>
So the last sad notes echoed away along
the sterile hills, and there was silence
under the starlight.
</p>

<p>
The horses were pulling at the grass,
or roving about with a quick, sharp clank
of the hobbles, the man on duty gliding
ghostlike among them, speaking to one
or another lest they should fear him in
the silence.  All seemed well with the
tired beasts, so the "picket" strolled
back to the dying fire, drank a little tea,
lit his pipe, and stood thinking.  His body
seemed gigantic against the light, his face
borrowed something of satanic dignity
from the glare, the light glimmered upon
the points of his harness, while he kicked
lazily the backs of smouldering logs till
the flames leaped up again.  Poor
Blackguard!  His thoughts were bitter that
night; memories of the innocent-seeming
child he had grown to love, and still
trusted lovingly, until under the girl's
frank laugh he had seen the woman's
flirting.  She was a woman&mdash;playing fast
and loose&mdash;Miss Violet the Vixen,
irresponsible.  The Blackguard's heart was
too great for her understanding, a wonderful
spirit of passionate tenderness, compassionate
forgiveness, and large tolerance.
The surface of him was all humour and
quaint devilry, the depth of him hid much
love and curious wisdom.  She had tried
to play with him the game of cat and
mouse; so, smiling inly at her mistake,
he had gone away, sending no word or
giving any sign.  When the cat wanted
her mouse again, when she longed for
him and could not do without him, she
would send him a sign.  If not&mdash;the
Blackguard sighed over his pipe.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he had been good through
these summer months to no purpose;
a lot of genuine religion had very likely, it
seemed, been wasted, desperate efforts
after wealth and respectability all thrown
away.  In that case, a couple of weeks
hence, when his five years expired, he
would spend the money he had made and
saved in giving the "boys" a lively night
or two, then re-enlist and be as bad as he
pleased.  But yet, if she would send a
sign.
</p>

<p>
He looked up, hearing the crackle of a twig.
</p>

<p>
"Halt&mdash;who goes there?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"All right!" came a shaky voice out
of the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Advance, and be recognised!"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Advance, or I fire!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, give us a rest."
</p>

<p>
These were the war challenges, and the
Blackguard had only used them to scare
an evident stranger who did not know
enough to say "Friend."
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said.  "Advance, and
be damned.  Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Blackguard!  The very man
I want&mdash;I'm Long Leslie."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, old chap.  Help yourself from
the tea kettle.  Well, how are things?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm fencing for General Buster," said
Leslie,&mdash;"got to earn our winter grub at
the Tough Nut."
</p>

<p>
"How's the claim?"
</p>

<p>
"Ripping.  Came on a splendid pay
streak up at the hanging wall.  These
contact propositions are always worth
assessments, anyway.  Shorty and me
are both working at Buster's, and when
I heard your bugle calls I thought I'd
stroll over.  Come up from Tobacco
Plains?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, bound north again."
</p>

<p>
"I guessed you were with this outfit."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, old man."
</p>

<p>
"I hear that Arrapahoe Bill is in
trouble up at the bull pasture on Throne
Creek."
</p>

<p>
"What's the old tough gaoled for this time?"
</p>

<p>
"Not that.  He seems to have been
having a scrapping match with a grizzly
bear, but I haven't heard if he'll live."
</p>

<p>
"Poor devil!  Any other news?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, that Tenderfoot of yours is
making the fur fly."
</p>

<p>
"What fur?&mdash;the Burrows girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; they're to be married before the
month end, according to the Lunatic.  By
the way, I've got something of yours.
She asked me to hand it over if I met
you.  Here."
</p>

<p>
A Mounted Police button dropped into
La Mancha's hand, but he said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"The bush fires are bad this fall on the
upper Kootenay."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and on the Mooyie.  Bitt's was
burned out last week."
</p>

<p>
"Serve him right for a good-for-nothing
greaser.  Well, I must be getting home.
Long day to-morrow.  Kind regards to
the boys.  Good-night, old chap."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night."
</p>

<p>
When the time came the Blackguard
kicked his relief awake, and the relief in
due course kicked another chap whose
turn was the morning watch.  The stars
were doing a very poor business that
night on account of the pungent dry
smoke from burning woods, but when
they gave up their half-hearted twinkling
as a bad job, the dawn mist rising from
the meadow was cool and ghostlike as
usual; full of dream-faces, if one could
only have seen them, ghosts of nice
children, pretty girls, and respectable
parents, who had come to call on the
Mounted Police while they were off duty.
</p>

<p>
Startling all the echoes, making the
keen ear tremble, waking the summer
world, and losing coherence in the distant
hills, reveille rang out clear and sharp, a
burst of triumphant, unexpected music&mdash;and
the night was gone.
</p>

<p>
Then, to successive bugle calls, blankets
were rolled, waggons loaded, the horses
carefully tended, breakfast was eaten, and
almost before the sun had lighted the deep
ravine the mounted party began to toil
up the hillside, and the waggons followed
groaning across the meadow.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<p>
Miss Violet and the Tenderfoot were
sitting on a bench in front of the cabin,
she peeling potatoes, he watching her.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," she said wearily.
</p>

<p>
"And then we shall have a house in
Park Lane."
</p>

<p>
"We had that before&mdash;next door to
the Duke of Something."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, in the ground just above; I
forget the number.  I shall have a private
hansom to drive down to Board Meetings
in the City; and when I come home tired
in the evening you shall entertain all the
millionaires we do business with.  We
shall get tremendous investments over
the dinner-table.  Won't it be jolly?"
</p>

<p>
She yawned.  "Yes, I suppose so.
What will you do with my Uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he shall be our general agent in
South Africa."
</p>

<p>
"That's a long way off, and perhaps
he'll get wrecked coming home.  I
like that part.  He shall have a large
memorial window."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a huge one, or say a dozen in
St. Paul's Cathedral.  Of course, I shall
be a great benefactor to all sorts of
things, and they'll put your picture in
the <i>Sketch</i> as the great philanthropist's
wife; of course, with an interview."
</p>

<p>
"An interview all about you, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, about my great gifts to the
Polytechnics, my College for Commercial
Travellers, my County Council work."
</p>

<p>
"Then you can write the beastly thing
yourself; so there!"
</p>

<p>
"I intend to be a very great man,"
said the Tenderfoot dreamily.  "Of
course, you must never interrupt me in
the evenings when I'm busy dictating
letters to my secretaries."
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do then?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know.  You'll have lots
of things to manage&mdash;servants,
dinner-parties, and"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
She dropped her potatoes and kicked
over the pail, scattering its contents
broadcast.
</p>

<p>
"Pick them up," she said.
</p>

<p>
He picked them up.
</p>

<p>
The little lady sat with her elbows on
her knees, her face in her hands, sniffing
at the acridness of raw potatoes, staring
gloomily the while out into the Sunday
stillness of the afternoon.  "I wish I
was dead," she said miserably, addressing
the Rocky Mountains over the way.
</p>

<p>
"But why?"  He sat up on his
haunches, the pail in one hand, an earthy
vegetable in the other, staring horrified.
"You shouldn't say such things.  It's
wicked.  I won't have you say such
things.  I forbid it."
</p>

<p>
"You won't?" muttered Miss Violet
vindictively; then gazing down at him
with portentous emphasis she said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Damn!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you say.  It's always you&mdash;'I'll
this, or I'll that.  It's my wish&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I.'  You're
made of I's.  There's nothing else
in you but 'I.'  Now, you listen to what
little me says&mdash;I hate you, and if I marry
you I'll make you as miserable as I am, you toad."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I love you."
</p>

<p>
"No, you don't&mdash;you only love yourself;
but I've got to marry you to get
away from my Uncle.  He gets on my
nerves.  Go away!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ramsay stared.
</p>

<p>
"Go away!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ramsay went mournfully away
down towards the mill, where
Mr. Burrows was saying his Sunday afternoon
prayers to the steel cylinder.  Half-way,
among the trees, and just out of
sight from the cabin, was a big wooden
flume carrying water-power for a plant
of turbines which turned the Burrows'
generators, which actuated the fans,
which ground the stone, which held the
gold, which was to pay for the Park
Lane house&mdash;for that is the stuff which
dreams are made of.  Mr. Ramsay sat
down on the flume feeling very miserable.
</p>

<p>
But he felt worse than miserable
presently when he saw a horseman ride
up to the mill whom he recognised to
his utter disgust as the Blackguard.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Burrows!"  La Mancha's big
voice rang out through the woods.
"Want a word with you, Burrows.
Come out and talk like a white man.
You won't?&mdash;ah, well, I'll talk while you
keep your mouth shut.  Are you in
charge of Miss Violet Burrows?  You
are, eh?  All right, I'm paying my
addresses to Miss Violet, and if she'll
have me I'm going to marry her.  D'you
hear?  Yes, marry her.  I didn't ask for
your consent&mdash;I only ask favours from
gentlemen.  All right, Burrows, be good
to yourself."
</p>

<p>
So, having propitiated her guardian,
La Mancha turned his horse uphill to
propose to the lady.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Mr. Ramsay was considerably
ahead, out of sight, running through
the trees for dear life, determined to get
the lady out of his reach.
</p>

<p>
"Violet," he cried hysterically, coming
up before the cabin, "come with
me&mdash;there's a great big cariboo grazing up
on the spur."  He ran into the cabin,
snatching up his rifle.  "Come&mdash;by the
back way&mdash;quick!"
</p>

<p>
"You saw a cariboo?" said Miss
Violet calmly.  "You were down in
the timber and you saw him up on the spur?"
</p>

<p>
"Come quick!" he cried in an ecstacy
of excitement.  But she would not move
from her seat.  Then the Blackguard
emerged from the timber, riding steadily
up the slope.
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Miss Violet.  "Be quick,
Charlie, or you'll lose your cariboo; I'll
stay here."
</p>

<p>
Mad with excitement, Mr. Ramsay
seized her forcibly by the wrists, and
half dragged, half carried her into the
cabin.
</p>

<p>
"You shan't meet him," he cried.
"You shan't!&mdash;you shan't!"
</p>

<p>
Flushed with a sudden rage, Miss
Violet wrenched herself loose, struck him
violently across the face, then ran out of
the cabin and breathless down the hill.
</p>

<p>
When the Blackguard jumped from his
horse at the sight of her, she, scarce
knowing what she did, flung herself into
his arms.
</p>

<p>
"My love," he said gently, "what's
the matter?&mdash;poor little woman, who
frightened you?"
</p>

<p>
She was crying like a frightened child,
clinging to him, swaying to and fro,
while the big sobs shook her little body.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly she stopped short, and
looked up in his face very much surprised.
</p>

<p>
"What was I doing?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Breaking my heart with your trouble&mdash;poor
little woman.  Tell me who hurt
you, and I'll kill him at once.  Why,
your wrists are all bruised and red.  Who
dared to touch you?"
</p>

<p>
But she would not say.
</p>

<p>
"Then I won't bully you by asking
questions, dear.  I love you too much
for that.  I came the first moment I
could when I got the button."
</p>

<p>
"What button?" she asked with the
frankest innocence.
</p>

<p>
"What button!" he laughed.  "A
little bit of brass that said 'Come back'&mdash;that
said 'I love you, Blackguard,
though you are a bad lot.'"
</p>

<p>
"You are, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I was until I loved you, dear; but
now&mdash;by the mercy that is in love&mdash;I'm
good again.  Do you know what is the
loveliest thing God ever made?&mdash;Laughter
and tears mixed up in a woman's face.
And you've confessed you love me!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly."
</p>

<p>
"That means, don't wait," and so he
kissed her on the lips.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I quite love you, after
all; you've never put on your uniform yet
when you've come to see me.  I suppose
I'm not worth all that trouble, though."
</p>

<p>
"I will next time," he said,&mdash;"for our
wedding-day."
</p>

<p>
"Our what?"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down and I'll tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Won't your horse run away?"
</p>

<p>
"Who could run away when you're in
sight, Violet?"
</p>

<p>
"That's quite nice.  They say things
like that in a novel."
</p>

<p>
She sat down beside him, and they two
watched the black horse smelling the
local grass with an air of disparagement.
</p>

<p>
"It's very silly of you to marry a
Blackguard, Violet."
</p>

<p>
"I never said I would."
</p>

<p>
"They only say it in books.  In life
they mean it.  Do you know, I've nothing
to marry on but three pigs, a few boxes
of cigars, one hundred dollars, and the
chance of a job breaking horses?  Now,
I suppose you could do much better than
that, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"A house in Park Lane," she said,
"and dinners for City people in the
evenings; but I mustn't interrupt him
while he's busy."
</p>

<p>
Her hand stole into his, and he kissed
it after the manner, perhaps, of the
Spanish Court.  Then he thought&mdash;after
the manner of the Blackguard&mdash;that lips
were not so cold, and more responsive.
</p>

<p>
They were.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know," she said, half
frightened, "that this moss is very damp?"
</p>

<p>
"My lips are still very dry."
</p>

<p>
At that she sprang up, laughing.
"Catch me," she cried; "catch me,"
and she ran for the woods.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<p>
Since the Blackguard's time had nearly
expired, the Colonel sent for him.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, La Mancha; I want a few
words with you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir."  The Blackguard
removed his forage cap, and sat down on
a camp-stool just within the tent.
</p>

<p>
"The Sergeant-Major tells me that you
do not wish to 'take on' again.  We
have served together some years now, La
Mancha."
</p>

<p>
"And jolly good years they were, sir."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel smiled.  "Well, I don't
grudge them&mdash;we've had a good mistress
to serve, besides fine work to do for her,
breaking in this rough young country;
but perhaps it's just as well to think of
the future."
</p>

<p>
"I hear, sir, that you've bought a big
ranche near Macleod."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I hope to serve as a citizen for
the rest of my time.  If ever you come
that way I can promise you a welcome."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Colonel; I shall remember that."
</p>

<p>
"You see, La Mancha, all my best men
have left me one by one.  Two of them
fell during the Rebellion, one shot
himself, Peters died of mountain fever at
Battleford, Buster Joe is ranching in
Montana, Jones the Less writes to me from
London, where he is doing well, and&mdash;but
you know.  One can't take such an interest
in the recruits&mdash;shave-tails, you call
them, and so forth; and now that things
are settling tamely down, we're not so
necessary as we were.  New times, new
manners&mdash;I don't blame you for taking
your freedom.  What are your plans, La
Mancha?"
</p>

<p>
"First, I'm going to marry."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, the Burrows girl up at the
Throne.  At first I hope to do something
at breaking horses, then take land down
the valley.  Her life won't be rougher
than it is now."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel smiled, because at last he
knew the secret of La Mancha's reformation.
</p>

<p>
"May I congratulate you?  I do most
heartily, for I'm told that she's the nicest
and prettiest girl in Kootenay."
</p>

<p>
"Will you come to the wedding, sir,
on the twenty-fifth, at the Mission?  The
Padre says he'll be ready for me at noon."
</p>

<p>
"I would like to come very much,"
said the Colonel; "but among other
details&mdash;mind I know you well&mdash;have you
the young lady's consent?"
</p>

<p>
"She says I'm not half good enough
for her&mdash;that looks all right, sir,&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
The Colonel laughed.  "I'll be there if
I can."
</p>

<p>
"And give the bride away, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"But how about Burrows?"
</p>

<p>
"Hang Burrows&mdash;he'll have take a
back seat."
</p>

<p>
"One thing more, La Mancha.  In this
particularly risky business has it occurred
to you that you ought to have steady
employment?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll have to turn 'road agent' otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"Rather than that, I'll give you a note
to my friend General Buster, who, I know,
is looking out for a good man.  Ride
down and see to-morrow, and while you're
about it take a two weeks' furlough up to
the date of your discharge.  Why, that's
the twenty-fifth, your wedding-day!"
</p>

<p>
"It's awfully good of you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it.  I'll send you the
letter by the Orderly Corporal.  Ask him
to step this way."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you poor devils," said the Blackguard,
lying at ease on his blankets, to
half a dozen men at work in the tent
cleaning their accoutrements for to-morrow's
muster parade.  "Sweat, you poor
workers; ram your button-sticks down
your throats for coolness."
</p>

<p>
One of the boys heaved a boot brush at
him, which he caught deftly.  "Now I'm
richer," he said "by a brush.  Gentlemen,
this brush of solid squat root,
bristled out of the Quartermaster's
private beard, heavy with valuable
blacking,&mdash;how much am I offered for this
brush?"
</p>

<p>
"Damn you and your brush."
</p>

<p>
"One damn for the brush.  Gentlemen,
I am offered one for this priceless object
of virtue&mdash;one damn I am offered,&mdash;going
at one&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;positively thrown
away!" and he flung it at the owner's
head, making a bull's-eye.
</p>

<p>
The victim had not time to be resentful,
but, wiping his eye with the back of the
brush, went on polishing his boot-tops
vindictively.
</p>

<p>
"Lick, spit and polish," laughed the
Blackguard.  "Every day has its dog;
but I'm a free nigger to-morrow.  No
more parades, no more pack-drill, no
more guards, no more cells, no more
'fatigues' save this bed-fatigue, which
suits my temperament.  I'm a free wolf,
and it's my night to howl; I come from
Bitter Creek&mdash;the higher up the worse
the waters&mdash;and I'm from the source.
Go it, you pigeon-livered shave-tails;
clean your harness, you poor-souled
recruities, you pemmican-eaters, you ravenous
pie-biters, you ring-tailed snorters.
This is my song of victory after five years
without beer&mdash;five years h&mdash;l without
benefit of clergy, five years everybody's
dog on Government rations!
</p>

<p>
"The Blackguard was taken young
and raised on hard tack, was full of skilly,
beans, and sow-belly; sweated on parade,
rode hell-for-leather after horse-thieves;
but now he's going to have a good time
being alive, and don't you forget it!"
</p>

<p>
By this time missiles were flying at him
from all directions, but the Blackguard
wriggled away, rolled out under the flap
of the tent, and went off to chaff Dandy
Irvine.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Dandy," he burst into the
next tent, but his chum was not there.
</p>

<p>
"Not there.  Lord, how I shall miss
him," thought the Blackguard, strolling
miserably towards the river.  "Ah,
there he is, sitting just where we sat the
night before I turned good.  What a
fool I was to do it."
</p>

<p>
He sat down beside the little Corporal.
</p>

<p>
"Did the Colonel give you a letter for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;here it is.  You have two weeks'
leave from to-night."
</p>

<p>
La Mancha told him all that the Colonel
had said.
</p>

<p>
"You're in luck, old chap."
</p>

<p>
"Now, don't you get mawkish," said
the Blackguard roughly.  "The Colonel
was bad enough, but I won't stand any
rot from you.  After all these years,&mdash;ye
gods, what a wrench it is!  I'm as weak
as a kitten, and all my bones feel sick.
Come over to the lines&mdash;I'm going to take
my horse these last two weeks, whether
they like it or not."
</p>

<p>
"There'll be an awful row," said Dandy
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"So much the better.  Trouble and I
are twins, but I'll have my horse."
</p>

<p>
"I guess I can stand the racket," said
Dandy, as they walked to the lines.
</p>

<p>
Last post was sounding while La Mancha
saddled, and in the midst of his work
he turned on Dandy.
</p>

<p>
"Don't look at me like that!  It's all
your fault for making me turn respectable.
It's against Nature.  What would the
civilians think if all of you turned into
brass-mounted saints like me?  Why,
they would be sending their sons into
the Force for convent training, and
adulterate the grandest cavalry in the world.
There"&mdash;he loosed his horse and flung
himself into the saddle.  "Cut it short," for
Dandy could not let go his hand.  "Say
good-bye to the boys for me.
Good-night&mdash;good-bye, and be hanged to you."
</p>

<p>
So he rode out of the camp at a
headlong gallop; but half a mile away drew
rein, for "Lights out" was sounding.  He
took off his hat, and brushed his sleeve
across his eyes, because there seemed to
be a mist between him and the tents,
while through his mind there swept the
music of an old-time song which belongs
to the Mounted Police&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The sentry challenged at the open gate,<br>
  Who pass'd him by, because the hour was late&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Halt!  Who goes there?'&mdash;'A friend'&mdash;'All's well.'<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A friend, old chap!'&mdash;a friend's farewell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I had pass'd the gate.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the long last notes were shed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The echoing call's last notes were dead&mdash;<br>
  And sounded sadly as I stood without<br>
  Those last sad notes of all: 'Lights out!'  'Lights out!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Good-bye, you fellows!  We have side by side<br>
  Watch'd history's lengthen'd shadows past us glide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And worn the scarlet, laughed at pain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buried comrades lowly lain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the long years glide;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toil and hardship have we borne,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And followed where the flag had gone&mdash;<br>
  But all the echoes answ'ring round about<br>
  Have bidden you to sleep: 'Lights out!'  'Lights out''<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And never more for me the helmet's flash,<br>
  The trumpet's summons&mdash;Oh, the crumbling ash<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life is hope's fruition: Fall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wither'd friendships, and they all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are sleeping!  Fast away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fabrics of our lives decay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And change unseen and melt away&mdash;<br>
  Ay, perish like the accents of a call,<br>
  Like those last notes of all: 'Lights out!'  'Lights out!'"<br>
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<p>
The Blackguard was a terror to evil-minded
horses, heavy enough when he
chose to almost break their backs, strong
enough to inflict most merciless punishment,
alert to outwit all manner of
devilry, because he had the gift of seeing
things from the horse point of view.
When they submitted, he could be gentle
enough, but that they had to find out by
surrendering first to his mastery.  He
had a wonderful way of disarming the
fears and winning the confidence of
frightened colts, so that, while the
dangerous animals feared him, the gentler
beasts found him the best of friends.
There is no doubt that from the very
start he was the best "buck hero" ever
known in Kootenay.  Too heavy for a
cowboy, he was an excellent teamster,
a fairly good hand with an axe, so that
General Buster's only misgiving was the
fear of losing him.
</p>

<p>
But he was not happy&mdash;a big tree
hauled out by the roots cannot be
expected to have a very joyful time just at
first.  Besides that, a thirty years' habit
of being bad is stronger than a four
months' habit of being good.  It seemed
now that to be virtuous was to lose all
the fun.  He would drift a little, and
haul up with a jerk; he would rebuke
with hard fists some champion of the
cowboys; then, thinking that he had
done something wrong, look up the
Selkirk foothills as though he hoped for
further guidance from the Throne.  From
the skin outwards this Blackguard was
an epitome of hardened wickedness,
inwardly like a big child.  After being
thirty years or so without a soul, he was
bewildered with the new possession which
had delicate little sympathies to be
exercised, a kindliness toward men and beasts
past all restraint, a weakness for Miss
Violet Burrows far stronger than himself.
So far as he could see, with limited
powers of introspection, his internal
anatomy consisted of love and whims.
In his bewilderment he wrote to the
Padre describing these symptoms, a letter
which was received by the Curate with
howls of laughter.
</p>

<p>
If the Blackguard's troubles were comic
in the valley, Miss Violet's were tragic
upon the mountain.  Mr. Burrows had
begun to fancy himself as a disciplinarian,
confined Miss Violet to the house, and
explained his views at great length every evening.
</p>

<p>
"I will have no more of this nonsense.
Your business, Mr. Ramsay, is mining
machinery, not the perpetration of
matrimony.  Matrimony, sir, is a
nuisance&mdash;early matrimony an utter absurdity.  I
have always disapproved of"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I may mention," said the Tenderfoot,
bristling, "that with your consent I am
engaged to Miss Violet."
</p>

<p>
"Booh!" said Miss Violet softly all
to herself, looking out upon these lords
of creation from behind the sitting-room
door.  So far as Mr. Burrows knew, the
wicked girl was locked up for the night
in her own chamber, but then, Mr. Burrows
knew very little about anything
human, nor did he perceive the elementary
facts about a woman.  It never occurred
to Miss Violet that she was other than
very sleepy until he turned the key for
her safe keeping.  Then she became
wide-awake, tried the door, poked about
in the lock with a bent hairpin, and to her
utter astonishment found that she could
release the bolt.  So, dressed like an
angel in fluttering white, with bare pink
feet and mane of streaming hair, she
crept across the sitting-room, wondered
what the men were plotting in the
verandah, and took her station in the
shadow behind the door.  She stood
on one leg timorously, thus leaving
only five toes to be preyed upon by
imaginary mice, the other foot being
curled up because it was cold.  Then,
when the Tenderfoot announced himself
to her Uncle as still engaged to
be married, Miss Violet whispered "Booh!"
</p>

<p>
"Moreover," continued Mr. Ramsay
loftily, "my immediate marriage was
included in the terms of our agreement
as to the mine."
</p>

<p>
"How dare you dictate to me?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll see how I dare.  Look here,
Burrows, your accounts, as I showed you
to-day, are all botched up."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Burrows calmed down partially.
"Bah! a trifling oversight like that is
not of the slightest consequence.  Besides,
I would have you realise that I am no
mere accountant."
</p>

<p>
"So I'm writing to the firm at home.
They'll turn loose a mere actuary over there."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Burrows gasped.  "To the best
of my knowledge and belief"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You submit a false balance-sheet
backed by an affidavit,&mdash;which is perjury
in London, Burrows, perjury."
</p>

<p>
"Bosh!  Of course, I must look over
the figures before they are actually sent
off."
</p>

<p>
"No, you don't," muttered Mr. Ramsay,
who was not half such a fool
as he looked.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing.  Have you another
cigar with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Here; let me light it for you."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause for the ceremony.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," continued Mr. Burrows, "there
is, as you say, much room for discussion
on both sides.  I cannot disguise from
you my own anxiety as to the fate of my
niece should this disreputable character
succeed, as you anticipate, in"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A runaway match?"  Mr. Ramsay
pressed home his advantage.  "Of
course, you sneered and sneered, although
I've warned you again and again that
his plans are well-nigh completed.  This
must be prevented, Mr. Burrows."
</p>

<p>
"What do you suggest?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, this experimental mill of yours
has got to be wrecked and abandoned
anyway.  On that the firm insists, and
your excuses for delay are getting too
thin, Burrows,&mdash;altogether too thin."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Burrows groaned.
</p>

<p>
"This business of yours, Burrows,
must be reported as an utter failure, or
we shall find the new ground held at
fancy prices.  We could have the mill
burned to-night by accident, the wedding
to-morrow at the Mission; then, you see,
Miss Violet would be safe from the
Blackguard."
</p>

<p>
Miss Violet had heard enough, in all
conscience, yet for a moment she could
not move.  Her curled-up foot went
boldly down among the imaginary mice
upon the floor, for this was more exciting
even than live rats.  She shivered a little,
partly in compliment to the autumn chill,
but more with cold fright.  Then her
growing resentment made the warm
blood race through her veins.  She
flushed with indignation, and in another
minute, boiling over with rage, would
have rushed out upon her enemies.  But
no; on second thoughts, she had a man to
do her fighting, a big brave man, whose
wickedness would be turned toward her
adversaries, whose love toward herself.
</p>

<p>
"Blackguard," she whispered into the
air,&mdash;"dear true Blackguard, you might
be ever so bad, but you're not a coward
like this Charlie."
</p>

<p>
Silently she crept across the room, in
breathless terror unlocked the back door
of the cabin and looked out.  The chill
struck her instantly.  She glanced
doubtfully at her bare feet, then, because she
could hardly feel respectable even by
starlight no better dressed than one of
the angels, she stole to her bedroom for
clothes.  There panic seized her, so,
grabbing up a cloak and a pair of slippers,
she fled out into the solitude of the hills.
Across the open she ran from cover to
cover, from rock to rock, stopping at
times, holding her breath as she looked
back, lest some crackling twig should
betray her.  One slipper was lost already
in a morass, but she went on, her poor
bare foot bleeding with a cut from some
stone.  Her long hair caught among the
branches when she had gained the wood,
and all the shadows of the trees were
full of awful eyes, of staring spectres, of
nameless beasts who would spring out
upon her if she looked.  Down the long
hills she fled, stumbling, falling, tearing
her cloak, suffering agonies from thorns
and stones, and greater agonies from
things unseen.  And so the poor child
came sobbing to the Tough Nut cabin.
The good prospectors would take a
message for her; they need not see her,
because she would hide, and when she
had roused them with her cries would
speak to them out of the very deep
shadows.
</p>

<p>
But when she called and called there
was no answer; when at last she dared
come nearer, creeping up with many a
start of sudden fright, she saw a padlock
glimmering on the door.  The cabin
was empty, the prospectors were away.
</p>

<p>
"Shorty!" she cried.  "Oh, Long
Leslie, where are you?  Help!  Help!"
</p>

<p>
The silence sank down heavily upon
the woods, all the spaces of the hills lay
in a breathless slumber, from the black
sky dead Alps looked down like ghosts,
and the stars were so far away.
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do, dearest?  How
shall I bring you to me.  Oh, my love,
my love!"
</p>

<p>
She sank down sobbing upon the
ground, the ground which was all covered
with gleaming pine chips left by the
miners' axes, the chips which they always
used to kindle fires.  To kindle fires?
She looked up, wiping the tears away
with her long hair.  They used these
scented chips to kindle fires, and she
would kindle such a blaze that night
that the news of it should go forth all
over the valley.  Then the Blackguard
would come to see what was the matter.
</p>

<p>
So she set off along the hillside, racked
with miserable cold, with bitter pain, the
tears dried stiff upon her cheeks, and
dragged herself to the mill, the mill
which was to be burned in any case.
There should be no doubt as to the mill.
She opened the lower door, the office
door&mdash;there upon the table were papers.
He had been working there all day&mdash;had
been very tired&mdash;had forgotten this once
to put them into the safe.  There was a
bunch of matches beside them, and on the
ground outside bushels of chips to make
the fire burn up, and in the corner of the
office a five-gallon can of lamp oil.  So
she piled up her fuel against the outer
wall.
</p>

<p>
That night there was a blaze upon the
mountains, the mill and the woods were
all afire.  So news went out along the
valley.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<p>
The Blackguard, coming to the mill at
high noon, found it a smouldering ruin,
and the woods above a smoking waste,
full of charred trunks.  Going round by
way of the Tough Nut Claim, he gained
the upper moorland, wrapped in a choking
dry mist, out of which rose the Throne
cabins, gaunt, spectral, desolate.  The
doors were locked, the windows barred
hastily across with a few rough planks,
the stable empty.  Down the hills he
rode, his black horse lathered with sweat,
his face haggard as he followed the trail
of three riders.  Ramsay had led, Miss
Violet followed, Burrows taking the rear,
all down the swaying curves of the steep
places, and along the sinuous path through
heavy timber.  They had not stayed to
even pack their clothes; they had not
watered their horses at the spring; they
had moved before daybreak, to judge by
the blundering course, and Miss Violet
had left here and there tokens, as though
he needed any further incentive, shreds of
white among fallen leaves, torn from a
handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
At last the Blackguard drew rein at the
foot of the mountains.  He looked towards
the camp where lay Arrapahoe Bill,
tended by the Mexican, recovering from
an interview with a grizzly bear; he
looked along the trail toward the
Mission, whither, to judge by the scraps of
cambric, Miss Violet had been carried
much against her will; and he looked
across the valley to where the tents of
the Mounted Police encampment glimmered
white in the afternoon sun.  It
was useless to trouble the cowboys,
useless to ride to the Mission unless he had
some sort of authority for interference;
better to get help from the camp.  Trusting
that the Padre would have sense
enough to delay the travellers, he set off
at a hand-gallop for Wild Horse Creek.
</p>

<p>
By mid-afternoon he gained the camp,
an hour later rode out again on a fresh
horse, accompanied by Dandy Irvine.
Both men were armed, both in uniform,
for they rode this time on Her Majesty's
service.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know," said Dandy, while
they splashed across the ford, "that this
was to have been your wedding-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Was to have been?  It is my wedding-day."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know that the Colonel went
off alone this morning, bound for the
Mission?"
</p>

<p>
"To give the bride away," said the
Blackguard, grinning.  "I knew he would
keep his promise."
</p>

<p>
Gaining the top of the bench-land,
they rode off at a canter across the
valley, through meadows scathed with
an early frost, by poplar bush, where the
leaves hung sere and yellow, or fluttered
dead to earth.  The wind was keen from
the north, the sky was overcast with
wintry cloud, and distant woods loomed
faint in a bluish haze.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know," asked Dandy,
"that they fired the mill?  It might have
been accident."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not quite blind," answered the
Blackguard.  "There was a five-gallon
can of kerosene lying outside the ruins."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"It was empty."
</p>

<p>
"What of that?"
</p>

<p>
"It was new, without a dint from being
knocked about, or any dirt from having
been used for filling lamps.  Whoever
burned the mill poured five gallons of oil
over the kindlings, then chucked the
empty can out through the door."
</p>

<p>
"What else?"
</p>

<p>
"Beside the can lay a half-burned torch
of paper, thrown away as the blessed
incendiary ran for his blessed life."
</p>

<p>
"Did you keep the torch and can?"
</p>

<p>
"Left them untouched for evidence.
D'ye take me for a two-months' rootie?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but I'm just about half sorry for
the great inventor."
</p>

<p>
Night had fallen when the two policemen
rode up to the Mission-house.  Within, Miss
Burrows, the Colonel, and the Curate
were playing an innocent game of cards;
without, in the porch, sat Mr. Burrows
and the Tenderfoot disputing hotly, but
they brought their discussion to an abrupt
close at the sight of Mounted Police.
</p>

<p>
"Good-evening, Mr. Irvine," said
Burrows easily, as the Corporal
dismounted, handing his rein to La Mancha.
"You'll find your commanding officer
inside the house, playing with my niece
a game called animal grab."
</p>

<p>
The Tenderfoot was staring hard at
La Mancha as he led the horses away.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, Mr. Burrows,"&mdash;the Corporal
produced two blue documents from
his breast-pocket,&mdash;"the game I have
come to play here is called human grab.
You, Mr. Burrows, and you, Mr. Ramsay,
are my prisoners."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
Dandy Irvine presented the warrants,
but the violent expostulations of the
prisoners brought the Curate and the
Colonel hurriedly to the door.
</p>

<p>
"What's all this?" said the Colonel.
"Why, Corporal Irvine, surely you've
made some mistake?"
</p>

<p>
Dandy saluted.  "Will you look at the
warrants, sir?"
</p>

<p>
The Colonel took one, glanced at it by
the lamplight within, and handed it back
to Corporal Irvine.  "This is very serious,
Mr. Burrows,&mdash;a charge of arson cannot
be lightly passed over, and Corporal
Irvine has only carried out his orders."
</p>

<p>
The prisoners were loudly protesting
their innocence, Mr. Burrows declaiming
on points of law and usage; Mr. Ramsay
almost in tears; but the Colonel required
their silence.
</p>

<p>
"Are you alone, Irvine?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  Constable La Mancha is
with me.  He has taken the horses round
to the corrall."
</p>

<p>
"Go, then, tell him to saddle the
prisoners' horses and my own.  I will be
responsible till you return.  Padre," he
turned to the Curate, "may Miss Burrows
remain as your guest?"
</p>

<p>
Constable La Mancha was at the back
door embracing Miss Burrows when
Dandy called him away.  "Come, none
of that," he said briefly; "I want you at
the stables."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Corporal,"&mdash;La Mancha
went on embracing Miss Burrows,&mdash;"be
with you in a minute."
</p>

<p>
"Don't cry, dear, there's nothing to
frighten you; but I had to get your
Uncle out of the way."
</p>

<p>
"But he's innocent!" she cried.  "You
ought to take me to prison for burning
the mill.  It was me."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce!"
</p>

<p>
"You know, dear, I had to make some
sort of signal."
</p>

<p>
"To bring me, eh?  Well, I don't
object to signalling&mdash;at least, not very
much.  Now, after we've gone, you make
it all right with the Padre.  Tell him the
whole story, and get him up very early in
the morning.  I'll be back by sunrise for
the wedding."
</p>

<p>
"By sunrise?" she blushed hotly; "I
never said I'd marry you, though."
</p>

<p>
"No, I was much too big a blackguard,
but now it's different, Miss Violet, quite
different, you minx.  I never burned my
Uncle's mill.  I was never half so wicked."
</p>

<p>
She laughed with delight at her own
wickedness.
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me," he said, and that she did
right heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Blackguard," Dandy was
quivering with impatience.  "You fool,
you're spoiling the whole game.  Hurry up!"
</p>

<p>
So La Mancha was dragged away to the
stables, where in due course the prisoners'
horses were saddled, also the Colonel's
grey charger.  Then came the champing
of horses' bits, the mounting of men,
farewells, and the filing-off of a solemn
procession into the night.  But Miss
Violet was left behind for safe keeping,
who, with her humble confession, her
tears, and a very few smiles, softened the
Padre's heart.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h3>

<p>
Great was the stir and turmoil at Wild
Horse Creek.  Long before daylight,
while all the gear was stiff with a rime
of frost, tents were struck, kit bags
loaded, blankets rolled; and after
breakfast these, together with the
Quartermaster's stores, mess kit, nosebags, and
all the equipments of a summer camp,
were bestowed upon the transport waggons.
At noon the troop was to march on
the first short stage of a journey across
the Rocky Mountains by the Crow's Nest
Pass to the winter station, the divisional
headquarters on the Great Plains.
</p>

<p>
But the wheels of routine were jarred
long before mid-day.  The Colonel had,
as a magistrate, to hear the charge of
incendiarism brought against the
prisoners, Burrows and Ramsay.  Moreover,
Regimental Number 1107, Constable La
Mancha, on the expiration of his term
of service, was to "turn in" his kit, to
receive his discharge, and to be struck
off the strength of the Force.  But neither
could the arson case be examined for
lack of the chief witness, nor could La
Mancha be discharged until he had
surrendered his horse, arms, accoutrements,
and clothing.  And the Blackguard
was absent without leave.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel was furious, reviled the
Sergeant-Major, placed the Corporal of
the Guard under arrest, also the picket
for permitting La Mancha's midnight
defection; the Sergeant-Major hurt the
cook's feelings by the tone in which he
ordered the unpacking of camp equipment
for dinner; the men waited comfortless
beside their horses; and all with one
accord reviled the Blackguard.  But
when the culprit rode in at noon,
accompanied by a lady whom he blandly
presented to the Sergeant-Major as the
Señora La Mancha, D Troop changed
its mind, greeting the Blackguard with
three rousing cheers.  From the Colonel
to the troop dog all realised that the
presence of a lady in camp had changed
the situation, particularly as the lady
was obviously attractive&mdash;a maid so
sweetly shy that everything must be
done to set her at ease, to smooth the
roughness of her surroundings, to show
D Troop on its best behaviour.
</p>

<p>
Leaving his wife in charge of Dandy
Irvine, as the most presentable man in
the division, La Mancha went about the
camp raking up ill-conditioned rags and
worn-out garments to represent his kit,
which was to be delivered over to the
authorities, together with his arms and
accoutrements.  At another time the
Quartermaster would have asked what scarecrow
had been robbed, now he received the
whole mess of rubbish with his blandest
smile.  Changing into his cowboy
equipment, the Blackguard gave away his
Government clothes to all who would
accept them as his parting gift, reserving
only a fine buffalo overcoat, a set of
blankets, and some underwear for future use.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel hastily, sitting as
magistrate, found means to discharge his
prisoners on the ground of insufficient
evidence.  Then the Sergeant-Major
presented La Mancha's discharge, filled
in with the obvious falsehood that his
character and behaviour were both, and
had always been, "very good."
</p>

<p>
"Now, La Mancha," said the Colonel,
"besides your pay you are entitled to
transport and sustenance to your place
of enlistment&mdash;Winnipeg.  Will you have
cash or a requisition?"
</p>

<p>
"Cash, sir."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel wrote out a cheque to
cover the costs of this imaginary journey
of twelve hundred miles, a second cheque
for La Mancha's pay up to date, and a
third in lieu of a wedding present from
the officers of the division.
</p>

<p>
Dinner followed, Dandy and all the
non-commissioned officers fighting among
themselves for the right to serve the
Señora La Mancha, who sat in state upon
a buffalo coat near their camp fire, all
smiles and blushes.  This was her
wedding breakfast, served under the
frosty blue sky by a swarm of soldiers,
who one and all would have offered with
the beef and bread their hearts and hands,
but for the prior claims of their comrade.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Blackguard, respectfully
declining invitations from the
Officers' and Sergeants' Messes, dined
for the last time with the troop, and
afterwards, when pipes were lit before
the saddling, accepted a wedding present
from D Division which would materially
help in his provision for married life.
</p>

<p>
Only Mr. Burrows and Mr. Ramsay,
discharged from their arrest and
welcomed by the Officers' Mess, were
discontented with the wintry sunlight, the
dry bright wind, the scent of the dying
summer.  Outwitted by the Blackguard,
humiliated in their summary treatment
by the law, their grievance received
hilariously as a huge joke, they were
only too glad to excuse themselves with
a plea of pressing business at the Throne,
while their crestfallen departure after
dinner provoked the troop to a burst of
ironical cheering.
</p>

<p>
But the Blackguard and his Señora,
mounted on horses lent by the Sergeant-Major,
rode out with the troop on its
first stage down the valley, an adventure
which Violet La Mancha will ever
remember as the most delightful thing in
her life.  Indeed, it was a sight to stir
one's blood, that march of frontier
cavalry, to see the big bronzed men
sitting their horses with careless grace,
the tough, wiry bronchos walking
sedately after a canter, the transport
lumbering briskly in the midst, and all
down the long double line of riders the
gleam of blue rifle barrels, a glitter of
belts, a glow of scarlet.
</p>

<p>
The valley reached away on every side
in all its loveliness of bush and prairie,
on either side hung white Alps above the
misty blue of distant forest, and over all
were soft little clouds like herds of driven
sheep, while the sun raced westward to
his setting through dim immensities of sky.
</p>

<p>
"See," said the Blackguard proudly
to his wife, "yonder, right at the foot
of the hills, I've built a cabin for you of
great big logs, and the chinks are all
filled in with moss to make it cosy.  The
hearth is in the snuggest corner, and all
the furniture is made with an axe of clean
red cedar, smelling ever so fresh, like
pencils.  You can look out among the
pine trees down to the creek, which is
full of trout for our supper, and I've
chopped away the bush, so that when
we sit by the door after sundown we can
see right away across the valley to the
great high peaks above the Crow's Nest
Pass.  Will you be contented, little one?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I shall always be content,
because I have you, my great big
Blackguard&mdash;and I love you."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
</h3>

<p>
Deep lay the snow in Kootenay.  All
across the prairies the great drifts were
like ocean rollers frozen,&mdash;against the
clumps of timber they were heaped like
winter surf, around the cabin curled over
to windward like a breaking wave.  One
could stand upon the comb of that wave,
so solid was it; indeed, the Señora La
Mancha had chosen the point of vantage
from whence to search the trail for some
sign of her husband's coming, because
he was late afield after stray cattle, and
it was long past supper time.  Grey
clouds were trailing across the moon,
casting shadows down which might have
been moving men or beasts among the
timber; but when the light shone clear
again on glittering frosty pines and dead
white drifts, it left an aching emptiness
as far as the eye could reach against the
intense cold, for it was 30 degrees below
zero Fahrenheit.  The little Señora was
guarded by a robe of beaver skins from
her bed, but her head was uncovered, so
that the moonlight caught her hair with
an icy lustre, and her congealed breath
was wafted back, filming over her rosy
face with hoar frost.  Despite her anxiety
for the Blackguard, who might well have
been delayed by a serious accident, she
felt with every breath the racy intoxicating
freshness of the air; so, when a
frost-bite stabbed the tip of one ear like
a red-hot needle, she only took some
powdery snow in her mittened hand to
rub the white place red again.  After all,
a frost-bite is nothing more serious than
a sneeze in the hardy West, so Violet La
Mancha danced a little dance on the snowdrift,
then, warm again to her finger-tips,
awaited her husband's coming.
</p>

<p>
He came at last, galloping up the trail
with a lusty yell or so by way of greeting,
and, waving her handkerchief in response,
the housewife fled indoors to serve a
steaming supper.  Ten minutes
afterwards, when he came floundering in
from the stable, and shook the snow
from his clothes like a big rough dog, he
found the beef and tea set out on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Feed the brute," said he.  "The
Wolf could gobble up Mrs. Wolf for an
after-thought.  Wough, but it's cold,&mdash;and
you should have heard me cursing
the runaway steers."
</p>

<p>
"That's good, letting off the fireworks
where they do no harm, in the open.
Why, some men keep all that for the
little wife.  Sit down, Blackguard, we've
got a lovely stew, and three real onions
in it.  Oh, I've been ever so lonely!"
</p>

<p>
"Serve you jolly well right for being a
cowboy's wife.  Lonely, you minx, you'd
be lonelier still if I hadn't caught you in
time three months ago."
</p>

<p>
"Three months! three whole big
months flown like a dream.  Only think!
You've cheated me out of three long
months of my life, you darling.  Now
pull those nasty icicles off your
moustache, or how can I possibly kiss you?"
</p>

<p>
"Sweet little lover; we've spent three
months in heaven, and only had fresh
meat once in all that time."
</p>

<p>
"Love and fresh meat, 'that's what
men are made of.'"
</p>

<p>
So they supped merrily, and washed
up afterwards, both talking at once, and
all the time of cattle and domestic details
mixed; and then she filled and lit his
pipe, he growling amiably of her manifest
incompetence in these arts, she being a
woman.
</p>

<p>
"Has the mail come?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; only one wretched paper."
</p>

<p>
"Give me the wretched paper."
</p>

<p>
He read a little, while she set a
bucket to peel potatoes, using hot
water lest the ice should form under
her knife.
</p>

<p>
"Here," he said, "I'm sleepy with the
heat of that confounded stove.  You take
the paper.  I'll keep awake best if I peel
the potatoes for you."
</p>

<p>
She looked up, tears swimming in her
eyes, "When I was up at the Throne,
Mr. Ramsay liked to watch me peeling
potatoes."
</p>

<p>
"What a cad!  Well, he gets his
deserts&mdash;wealth from the Burrows' inventions
beyond the very dreams of avarice,
and much good may it do him."
</p>

<p>
"And I have a log-cabin, a nest to
keep warm for my big true Blackguard,
and thanks to say on my knees to God
for love.  What does it matter all this
stuff in the paper?"  She laid it on her
lap, watching his comic clumsiness at the
peeling.  "The world outside doesn't
matter one little bit to us."
</p>

<p>
"Read anyway," he said, grinning,
"or you'll drop into poetry next."
</p>

<p>
"'Horrible Murder,'" she read,
yawning.  "Oh, I wish it was bedtime.
'Suicide of a Vegetarian.'  'Fuss, Box,
&amp; Co. in Bankruptcy.'  'The Railroad
Horror.'  Hello, here, under the Cavalry
heading, there's Dandy Irvine&mdash;Sergeant
Irvine&mdash;got a commission.  They've made
him an Inspector."
</p>

<p>
"Good old Dandy!  We'll drink his
health next time I can buy the ingredients."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want ingredients," she said,
pouting; "he's such a little dear, and
you can never keep tidy, however I dust
you and scrub.  Must I read any more?
Well, here's the British Empire column.
'London, February 6&mdash;Death of the
Spanish Ambassador.  We regret to
say,'"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Blackguard whistled softly.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she looked up, "what's the
matter?  Did you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, that's the Snob."
</p>

<p>
"The what?"
</p>

<p>
"My brother.  I asked him once
whether he'd have a long life or his
habits.  He had the habits, and I hope
he enjoyed them.  Poor Snob, I guess
he's left me the reversion of his debts."  The
Blackguard finished peeling the last
potato, and handed over the pan.  "Will
your Grace be pleased to put these
potatoes away?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Only, my little wife, that you are a
Duchess now."
</p>

<p>
"A Duchess?  What nonsense!"  Coming
across to his chair, she kissed
him tenderly upon the forehead.  "I'm
nothing," she said, with a gay little
laugh, "but Mrs. Blackguard."

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
